This tune played in a slightly faster, joyfully sweet tempo (with 2 line intro)

The tune played in a more intimate and highly personal way (with 2 line intro)

1. Enraptured in Your Love⁠— how fresh and new!  
    Infuse me with Your Love⁠— sweeter, fresher than dew!  
    Your love (embrace me close) does forward guide;  
    I revel in Your love, on Your breast abide.  
    How I yearn, O Lord, to delight in love,  
    By Your love o'ershadow me.  
    A banner over me: Your love⁠— Yourself,  
    For Your love and Yourself are one

2. You are my dearest One, my only Love.  
    Yes, Lord, now You alone are the object of love.  
    If You redemption give and only love,  
    I know my heart won't be fully satisfied.  
    How I yearn, dear Lord, Your own self to gain,  
    For I know it's only You.  
    It's You that I pursue, and You are love;  
    My sole Treasure You are to me.

Words: Titus Chu, 1973, tr. from Chinese, adapted
