_A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed._

_I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad. Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together. I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, And delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto him, and were radiant; And their faces shall never be confounded. This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of Jehovah encamps round about them that fear him, And delivers them. Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good: Blessed is the man that takes refuge in him. Oh fear Jehovah, you who are his saints; For there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; But they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing._
