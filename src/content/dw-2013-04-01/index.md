_Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.  So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there three years. The heart of King David longed to go out to Absalom. – Second Samuel 13:37-39a_

The second test for those in leadership is whether or not they will succumb to favoritism. Leaders nearly always exercise some amount of favoritism. When those in authority do not lead impartially according to merit, unrest and competing parties can result. In spite of all this, it is difficult for leaders not to love some more than others.
