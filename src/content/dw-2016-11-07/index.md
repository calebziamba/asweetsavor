_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

The process of God’s calling includes five items which are experienced by everyone He calls. When God called Abraham, Abraham experienced these five items: 1) God’s initiating; 2) God’s appearing; 3) God’s call; 4) God’s promise; and 5) God’s power and unchanging nature. When we are called by God, we experience these five items.
