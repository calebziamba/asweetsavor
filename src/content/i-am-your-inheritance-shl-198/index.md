1. What a wondrous fact, O Lord, that  
    I am Your inheritance.  
    All Your boundless riches need the  
    Church Your fullness to express.  
      
    Chorus:  
    Oh! Objects of Your love, What we have become,  
    Manifest Your riches--The praise of Your glory!  
    Oh! Objects of Your love, What we have become,  
    Manifest Your riches-- To the praise of Your glory!  
      
    
2. I am blessed with every blessing  
    In Christ in the heavenlies;  
    Chosen ere the earth's foundation,  
    Holy I am saved to be

3. By the precious blood of Jesus,  
    We have fully been redeemed;  
    All offenses are forgiven,  
    Grace and wisdom pouring out.

4. Now the Spirit has been given,  
    Pledge of my inheritance;  
    Giving wisdom, revelation,  
    That Your Person I may know.

5. With enlightened inner eyes we  
    See the hope of Your dear call;  
    Power of Your resurrection  
    Manifested now in us.

6. Lord, as Your inheritance, we  
    Praise You now wholeheartedly;  
    We're Your Church and we're Your body,  
    Your fullness eternally!

Word: Titus Chu, 1972, tr. from Chinese, adapted  
Music: French carol, arr. by Edward S. Barnes
