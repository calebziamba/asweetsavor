_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

_Now Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has._ _– Genesis 24:36_

The third significant point concerning Isaac is that he inherited everything that his father had (Gen. 24:36). When Abraham’s servant sought a bride for Isaac, he told Rebekah’s father, “The Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys. Now Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has” (Gen 24:35–36).
