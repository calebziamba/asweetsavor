_“Your lips, my bride, drip honey;_ _Honey and milk are under your tongue,_ _And the fragrance of your garments Is like the fragrance of Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:11_

Honey revives people, and milk nourishes people. Honey gives us strength when we are tired. Milk feeds us when we are hungry. The tired are revived and the hungry are fed through our words. When people, young or old, weak or strong, come upon us, they will gain the riches of life.
