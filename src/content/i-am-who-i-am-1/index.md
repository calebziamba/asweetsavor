> God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”
> 
> \- Exodus 3:14, NASB

None of us would dare to say, “I am,” because tomorrow comes and today becomes “I was.” But, remember, there is One in this universe to whom there is not summer or winter. To Him, there is nothing called “this year” or “next year.” He said, “I am who I am. Do you want to know who I am? Do you want to know My name? It is hard to give you My name, but let Me tell you who I am: I am who I am.” What does this mean? That He is the self-existing and ever-existing triune God.
