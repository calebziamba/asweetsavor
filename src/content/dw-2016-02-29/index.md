The time of Noah marks the beginning of a new relationship between God and man. When God created Adam, He made him in His own image and commanded him to rule over all the earth (Gen. 1:27–28). God wanted man to fulfill His purpose of ruling for Him. However, at Noah’s time, the earth had become corrupt before God and filled with violence (6:11). Man had been exposed as being completely unable to fulfill God’s purpose. After Noah, God placed the demand on Himself. He made a new covenant with man and set the rainbow in the sky as the sign of this new covenant (9:12–17). When God sees the rainbow, He knows that the demand is all upon Him.
