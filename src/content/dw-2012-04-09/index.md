_And there was war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. — 1 Samuel 14:52_

_David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down to him. And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. — 1 Samuel 22:1-2_ Saul recruited the most capable men for the sake of his kingdom (1 Sam. 14:52). For instance, if someone from Harvard had appeared, Saul might have recruited him for his education department. If he were to see a graduate from West Point, he would have asked him to fill some role in his military. Saul, however, used these recruits as mere instruments to reach his own goals.
