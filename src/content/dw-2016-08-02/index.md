Your good character is useless if you do not have the divine life. If you have much of the divine life but do not exercise your good character, you will also be useless. It is only when you have both the divine life and a good character that you will be able to produce a personality that is useful to the Lord. Inwardly this personality will be full of the divine element, and outwardly it will be related to Godâ€™s desire. This is an absolute personality.
