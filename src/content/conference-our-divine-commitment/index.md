There is often pressure on the churches to care for something other than the Lord's testimony, such as certain practices, and to make those things our center of fellowship.

Therefore, in this time brother Titus' burden was to remind us that, as believers in Christ individually and as the churches of Christ corporately, we should only care for and exhibit Christ Himself. How wonderful is this divine commitment!
