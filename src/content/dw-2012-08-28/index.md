_“Who is this coming up from the wilderness_ _Like pillars of smoke,_ _Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,_ _With all scented powders of the merchant?”_ _There is Solomon’s bed._ _Sixty mighty men surround it,_ _Of the mighty men of Israel.”_ _— Song of Songs 3:6-7_

Brothers and sisters, we should be those in whom the Lord can rest. He should feel restful because of us. Because of her experiences in the first and second stages, the Lord’s lover has experienced the Lord’s love, the Lord Himself, the work of the Lord, the cross, and the church.

Now she is willing to come up from the wilderness and pay the price. The Spirit has worked in her, and by means of the cross’s work, life is able to flow from her. She has also become fragrant with the fragrances of Christ. At such a point the Lord can say, “Now in My seeking one I am restful.”
