_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

Rather than allowing God to work on us, we often make our own plaits, using the gift God has given us, so that others would notice our capability to carry out spiritual work or to minister in the church. Such service is superficial. What other people can see are your gifts, not God Himself. Although this may cause other saints to think that we are gifted and capable, we cannot fool God.
