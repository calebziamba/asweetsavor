_Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole Body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. â€” Colossians 2:18-19_

Have you ever experienced being in spirit, and not being able to love the brothers? When you are in spirit, every saint becomes lovely. When Christ is strongly operating among us, genuine oneness is present. We simply love one another. Christ is the unique source, element, substance, nature, sphere, and living out of the reality of oneness. When Christ is absent, the source of our oneness is gone. Any other kind of source in the church life becomes a source of division.
