> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
> 
> \- Philippians 3:14 NASB

Christ’s longing for us is that we, like Paul, would have a mind to press on toward the goal of gaining Christ (Phil. 3:14–  
15). For this we need to think the same thing. When other things become our goal, they become issues which trouble the church. For example, if we make anyone’s ministry an issue, our oneness will be gone. The same is true if we insist on a music style, biblical interpretation, or tongue-speaking. These things can become toys to us, and we may care more for these toys than for what is profitable to the church. It is better to drop our insistence than to lose the oneness.
