_“The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’ Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me.” — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

Due to God’s mercy, she experienced the suffering of the cross—loneliness, dryness, and poverty. She could do nothing but be with the brothers and sisters. She can now receive help from others with more experience.

Originally, she thought she alone belonged to the Lord, while others belonged to the work or religion. Now she realizes that the “sons of my mother” were her help. She is no longer self-centered; now the Lord is her center. She has seen something further about how to live before the Lord and among the saints. She is no longer independent of the Lord or merely an individual among the brothers and sisters.
