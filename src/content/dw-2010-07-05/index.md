_But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them. And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus. —2 Timothy 3:14-15_

The first thing we think of when we hear the word “equipping” is the truth. Yes, equipping ourselves is related to truth. But before we get into the truth, we have to pay attention to our person. We must equip our mind, emotion, and will as well as our spirit. If our person is not right, our equipping in the truth will become something of knowledge and doctrine.
