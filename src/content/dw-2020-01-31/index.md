_"Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in  
the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and  
camped before the city. ... Then he erected there an altar"  
\- Genesis 33:18, 20  
_

The tent showed that he knew he was a sojourner in the world and didn’t belong to it. The altar showed that his roots were in God, not in the earth. This gave him stability.
