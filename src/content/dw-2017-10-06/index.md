_Abraham came near and said, “Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?...Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?”_ _– Genesis 18:23, 25_

Most of us are not as mature as Abraham was here. At best, we live according to God’s leading. However, the Bible shows us a higher experience. Although it is true that Abraham had been led by the Lord, he had matured to the point that he saw the Lord’s need and cooperated with Him to fulfill it. The Lord’s need isn’t accomplished by His leading alone but by those who are matured in life to take the initiative to fulfill His work.
