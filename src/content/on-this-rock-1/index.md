> And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
> 
> Matthew 16:18

The Lord spoke these precious words to Peter and today He would still say these same words to you and me. Jesus told Peter he was blessed because upon this rock (revelation of Christ), I will build my church. Revelation may seem like a spiritual mystical term but practically speaking, a revelation that we receive from Christ should lead us to see something more of the church. As such, we as many stones, today, are able to be a part of the building up of the church. Today the Lord is focused on building His church and He will keep building the Church until she has made herself ready (Rev 21:2). Brothers and sisters, do we see this? And if we do see this, do our lives match this? The Lord said He will build His church but what about us? I will get my degree, I will have a nice house, I will go somewhere where the weather is nice, I will have a good retirement. How about the Lord? This is a very sober matter, may the Lord have mercy on us and can we have a prayer that Lord, we would like to be a part of this building work, we want to see more revelation and we want a living that matches our seeing.
