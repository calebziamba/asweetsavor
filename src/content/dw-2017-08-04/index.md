_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

Those who follow the Lord must abide in their initial vision of the Lord’s appearing. Once this vision grows dim, we may discover we are following others rather than following the Lord. At this point, we have two options. The first is to get desperate before the Lord to renew our initial vision of Him. The second is to forget about living for the Lord and start living for our own future and career.
