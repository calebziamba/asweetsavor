_“How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!_ _How much better is your love than wine,_ _And the fragrance of your oils Than all kinds of spices!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:10_

Brothers and sisters, would your labor make the Lord say, “How beautiful is your love”? Or do you still expect the Lord to praise the effectiveness of your labor?

The Lord will not praise your labor’s effectiveness. Instead, He desires to say, “How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!” In chapter 1, the Shulammite told the Lord, “Your love is better than wine.” Here it is the Lord telling her, “How beautiful is your love!”
