_The things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things; and the God of peace will be with you. — Philippians 4:9_

I speak with you concerning the example brother Lee left us with  in the hope that you might develop the desire to carry forward the Lord’s testimony. Once Brother Lee asked me, “When Brother Nee was gone, I was here. When I leave, who do we have?” I took this as a rebuke, and was ashamed. He did not say this lightly. Serving the Lord is not just a matter of reading the Bible. Those who wish to serve the Lord must have revelation, equipping in truth, and experience in life.
