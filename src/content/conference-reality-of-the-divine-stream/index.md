At the beginning and end of the divine revelation God shows us a river. He further reveals throughout the Scriptures that He reaches and works with humanity as a divine flow. What does the Bible tell us about this stream of God? As those who desire to serve and know Him in His economy today, where and how can we experience this flowing God?

These messages focus upon these two questions. They were given during a conference in January 2003 in Toledo, Ohio, to those serving the churches in the Great Lakes area. The spoken words bore witness of the divine stream to those present. What a wonderful blessing they became to those who heard!

Those who love God long to be kept in the sphere of His blessing and operation and to see His work on the earth progress. It is with this longing in view that these messages are presented to God's children.
