_Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.” — Genesis 28:16_

It is the small things that prevent you from being spiritual. You go to the barber and are not satisfied with your haircut; you buy new eyeglasses, and find something wrong with them; you are going somewhere in a rush, and end up in a traffic jam. These things happen because the Lord wants to equip you to be spiritual.

Our Lord is loving and He is jealous. Do you love some article of clothing? He is not happy about it. Are you attached to a plush towel? He does not like that either. He wants you to enjoy Him and to love Him alone. He is not happy if you are enjoying something besides Him.

Learn to confine your desire to the Lord alone. Enjoy the Lord's riches and His sweetness. If you are able to do this, you will be spiritual. When you are under the Spirit's authority, then you are a person of the Spirit. Such a person sees nothing as lucky or unlucky, right or wrong, good or bad—he sees all things as being from the Lord.
