_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

God’s complete salvation has two aspects: a judicial aspect called redemption and an organic aspect called salvation. On the cross, Christ accomplished redemption. Now, based on this redemption, God is working out our salvation.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 9.
