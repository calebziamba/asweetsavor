_And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him. — First John 2:27_

This anointing is the Triune God Himself, the constituting and operating Triune God in our spirit. What God is, the anointing is. The anointing substantiates in our spirit what Christ is, what Christ does, what Christ has accomplished, what Christ wants, and what Christ desires. If we are full of anointing, we are full of God, full of Christ, full of the testimony of the Triune God, and full of the Spirit’s flowing. The Lord is able to use such a one. May the Lord have mercy on us.
