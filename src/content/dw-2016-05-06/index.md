_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

I consider the clause, “with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves” (v. 3), to be one of the best expressions concerning the body of Christ. When our mind has the quality of humility, we are able to regard one another as more important than ourselves.

Adapted from __[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ,](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")__ pages 99-100.
