_“For your love is better than wine.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2_

Our Lord cannot reveal Himself to us all at once. If He did, we would not be able to stand before Him. He is too perfect. For example, He is holy and righteous. Eventually, as we come to know Him further, we will experience His judging. But if we had experienced all His judging at the time we begin to pursue Him, we would have died not only spiritually but also physically.
