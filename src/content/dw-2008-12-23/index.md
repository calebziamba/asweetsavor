_Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the house faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right side of the house, from south of the altar. —Ezekiel 47:1_

_I am crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. — Galatians 2:20_

The divine stream flows on the right side of the temple, by the side of the altar. The right side of the temple signifies the highest position, indicating that the Lord must have the pre-eminence in the divine stream. The side of the altar implies that the divine stream always flows beside the cross with those who are consecrated. Only those who are fully consecrated and take the cross can experience the freedom of the divine stream.
