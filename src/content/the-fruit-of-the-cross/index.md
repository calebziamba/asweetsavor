> I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me...
> 
> – Galatians 2:20

> Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new _man_ who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave _nor_ free, but Christ _is_ all and in all.
> 
> Colossians 3:9-11

If all that we see about the cross is suffering, then we will be short of its beauty. The full meaning of the cross was realized with Jesus’ death. When He died, He issued in a whole new set of principles by which man and God encounter one another; He produced a New Creation.
