_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

Satan is always working to provide reasons for us to grumble and dispute. He knows how easily these destabilize a healthy church. Rather than grumble and dispute, we should fellowship with one another thoroughly and openly. True fellowship means we refuse to live a life that bypasses God or bypasses others; we recognize and submit to God’s arrangement and Christ’s headship. This will save us from our grumbling and disputing.
