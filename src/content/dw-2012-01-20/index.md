_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the hem of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon That descended upon the mountains of Zion; For there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore. — Psalm 133:1-3_ Our oneness is like the “dew of Hermon.” Jerusalem is surrounded by mountains, and Mount Hermon is the highest of them all. Mount Hermon in the Bible signifies the ascended Christ. We know that Christ went through death and resurrection, and now He is in ascension. In His ascension He is likened to “dew.” Dew is produced after a cold, dark night. The Lord passed through the cold, dark night of death and entered into resurrection and ascension. In ascension the Lord now possesses the freshness of resurrection. The dew of Hermon is the ascended Christ with the freshness of His resurrection.

The dew of Hermon descended upon the mountains of Zion. Saints who are in the stage of maturity are all like mountains. But although there are many mountains there is only one Zion, which means that there is only one testimony. In this testimony we experience the descending dew, which is the freshness of the resurrected Christ. In the stage of maturity we eventually see nothing but resurrection in the church life. Every dear saint becomes a testimony of resurrection. We no longer see the flesh, the self-life, or the natural things; instead we only see the resurrected Christ. Based upon our oneness in maturity, the ascended Christ renders us the freshness of His resurrection for us to enjoy and experience. Praise the Lord for such a church life!
