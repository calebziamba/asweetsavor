A brother may be looking for an opportunity to make a show of himself among the churches. He may think, “This is a good opportunity for me to be manifested. Brother So-and-so will recognize my ability.” This attitude violates the principle of the divine operation. As long as the Body of Christ is organic and healthy, he may be successful for years. But eventually he will decline from the operation of the divine life.

It is not easy for one to learn and labor seriously if he desires a bright future and wants to be manifested. Most of his time will be spent “looking this way and that” (Exo. 2:12). If no one else is around, he might consider doing the job. “Looking this way and that” shows a problem in the personality. This kind of person cannot be used by the Lord.
