_For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ._ _– 1 Corinthians 3:11_

Without the presence of the Lord, our work and labor are in vain and have no value. If our Christian work is not firmly based on an initial vision of Christ, one day we will stand before Him shameful and miserable. Though we may be able to speak of the many things we have done in His name, He may tell us, “I never knew you; depart from me, you who practice lawlessness” (Matt. 7:23). Our first vision of Christ is our foundation. On that day, our only acceptable offering to God will be the Christ we have seen, experienced, and laid hold of in our life and service.
