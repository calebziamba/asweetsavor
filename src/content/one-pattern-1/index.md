> Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:17 NASB

For such a walk, we have patterns we may imitate. In order to follow such patterns, we need to have a learning spirit. Not only do we need to walk within our boundary of Christ, we also need to continue on as learners for the rest of our lives, taking as our pattern Paul and those who walk as he walks.
