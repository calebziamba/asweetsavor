_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. —Philippians 2:8–11_

In verse 9, the Greek word for “bestowed” is _charízomai_ (Strong, no. 5483), which is a form of the Greek word for “grace” (_cháris_). The Father graced Jesus with a name that is to be honored above all others.

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, pages 111-112.
