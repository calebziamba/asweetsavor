> Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 3:17

If you are exercised, if you are living in the Lordâ€™s presence, for sure your spirit will be so free, so strong, so dynamic, so life-imparting, so helpful to the church. And when you are so saturated with the spirit, for sure you will be so burdened with the gospel; you will be so burdened with weaker and younger ones; you will be so burdened with carrying the practical church life with other saints. Why? Because you are properly in your spirit.
