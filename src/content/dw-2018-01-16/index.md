_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

It is the same with us as it was with Rebekah. The Holy Spirit testifies to us of the riches of the Lord, and we are attracted to Him. We should not laugh at Rebekah since we are just like her. Even though we have never seen Jesus, we are able to believe He caused the blind to receive their sight, the lame to walk, the lepers to be cleansed, the deaf to hear, and the dead to be raised (Luke 7:22). We don’t know how the Lord resurrected and ascended but we are willing to give our life to Him, leaving everything for Him.
