_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._ _— Philippians 2:5–7_

Who was God? Christ. Who was Christ? God. Where is God? In Christ. Where is Christ? In God. He and God are one. Paul’s marvelous statement portrays how rich Christ’s eternal preexistence was. All the deity, divinity, divine attributes, intrinsic elements, and essential virtues of God Himself dwell in this person, Christ (Col. 2:9).
