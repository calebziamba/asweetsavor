_How beautiful you are, my darling, How beautiful you are! Your eyes are like doves behind your veil; Your hair is like a flock of goats That have descended from Mount Gilead. — Song of Songs 4:1_

In verses 1-5 of chapter 4, the king praises, “Oh, you are beautiful, my love!” Seven items in particular give rise to the king’s praise in this section.

First, the Lord declares, “Your eyes are like doves behind your veil” (4:1). A veil is something that covers and obscures. Being behind a veil means that she is hidden in the Lord and does not allow others to see what she has in herself. To the Lord, her eyes are beautiful because they are behind a veil. And she is as single as a dove as she looks at the Lord.

From chapter 1 we realize that the eyes of a normal Christian should be like doves (1:15). Now the seeking one has progressed, for her eyes are behind the veil, meaning that she does not open what she sees to others. She does not try to show others her spiritual insight and discernment. Her eyes are not only like doves but also behind a veil. If we are experienced, we will veil our spiritual insight in the church life.  The Lord likes our living before Him to be hidden from men, and He desires our eyes to see nothing but Him.
