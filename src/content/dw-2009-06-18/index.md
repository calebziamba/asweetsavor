_But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality. For He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. — John 16:13_ The Bible reveals that there is a way for us to enjoy Christ. That way is the Spirit. What will bring us into the reality of the enjoyment of Christ? It is the Spirit of reality, as revealed in John 16:13. This verse states, “For He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.” This means that the Spirit will constantly unveil to us all the riches of Christ. The Spirit of reality will declare these things to us.

If we are in the enjoyment of Christ, then every year we should be a different person. We become different when the riches of this wonderful Christ are constantly unveiled to us by the wonderful Spirit. If we want to enjoy the Lord, we must realize that all the enjoyment is in the Spirit of reality.
