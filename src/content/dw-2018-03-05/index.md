_The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth._ _– John 1:14_

This verse says that Christ is “full of grace and truth.” In fact, throughout John’s writings the word “truth” means more than just “correct”; it has the meaning of “reality.” Therefore, this verse means that when we enjoy Christ as grace, we also have Him as reality.
