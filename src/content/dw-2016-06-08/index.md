_The one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him._ _â€“ First Corinthians 6:17_

To understand the verse above we need to consider some related verses. According to John 3:6, it was in our human spirit that we were born of the Spirit of God:

_That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit._

Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us the Lord Jesus is the Spirit:

_Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty._

When we put these verses together, we see that once we are born again, the Lord as the Spirit is one with our human spirit, which is the deepest part of our being.
