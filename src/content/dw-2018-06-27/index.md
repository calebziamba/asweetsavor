_“This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.”_ _– John 15:12_

We need to say, “Lord, I’m so thankful that I can enjoy You as life. Now the life within me demands a new living. I realize that You have brought me into the body of Christ and have given me three commissions. Lord, I want to be faithful to Your three commissions.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 101.
