1. How marv’lous, how real that my God has entered me.  
    He’s joined with my spirit; one spirit now are we.  
    My spirit was empty and dead, apart from God  
    But now I’m revived as God’s life is filling me.  
      
    **Chorus**  
    As Spirit He dwells gloriously.  
    Two spirits are united as one.  
    Two lives are mingled, now God and man  
    Are incorp’rated as the God-man.

2. How rich and how full: God Himself abides in me.  
    He grows in my spirit; we’re mingling constantly.  
    I was in the world; I pursued my earthly dream,  
    I now have experience of His divinity.

3. How glorious, divine: God Himself does live in me.    
    His life saturates me; one person now are we.    
    So long I have fought and endeavored by myself    
    To live now is Christ: God Himself lived out of me. 

4. How heav’nly, mysterious: that God is built in me,    
    With Him constituted we’re dwelling mutually.    
    I strove with my heart to fulfill the law of God    
    But now I express all His fine humanity.
