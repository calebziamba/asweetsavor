_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?” — Song of Songs 5:3_

We might think that the Lord wants us to remain in our spiritually exalted state. We forget that although we have helped a few, there are multitudes of saints still under Satan’s power. We may have nourished some, but look how many are still in need of spiritual feeding. Our lack of realization causes us to reply the way we do. We forget that there is still a long way to go before the Lord can claim His corporate Bride. There are many more who need to be saved and cared for.

Thus far our having the same heart as the Lord’s and our being one with Him are limited to our small sphere of experience. We haven’t yet entered into all the riches of the Lord. His riches haven’t fully become our riches. The Lord, however, will not force us to follow Him. All He can do is keep knocking and asking until we become willing to follow Him again.
