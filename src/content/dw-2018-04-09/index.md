_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

_If any man’s work which he has built on \[the foundation\] remains, he will receive a reward._ _—1 Corinthians 3:14_

Like Paul, we should not only run in a race to receive a crown but also work in such a way that we receive a reward (1 Cor. 3:14).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 134.
