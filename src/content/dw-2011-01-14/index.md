_And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes; and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land. If the Lord is pleased with us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us — a land which flows with milk and honey. Only do not rebel against the Lord; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our bread. Their protection has been removed from them, and the Lord is with us; do not fear them." — Numbers 14:6-9_ Joshua was manifested at this time. He stood firmly with God for God’s interest and stood firmly with Moses as God’s appointed leader. While the others became grasshoppers and forgot their purpose, Joshua and Caleb stood firm. They could say they were on the Lord’s side, that they were standing with God, that they trusted God’s speaking. They held firm to the vision they had seen, which had become the goal of their service to the Lord.
