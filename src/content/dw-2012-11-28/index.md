_For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad._ _— Second Corinthians 5:10_

The Lord’s work is grand. Who will be rewarded on that day? It may not be those who did a large work in the Lord’s name, but rather those who were faithful to the small commitment given them by the Lord (Matt. 7:22; 25:21). We should be more concerned about winning the Lord’s smile on that day than about the turbulence that may result from our actions today.
