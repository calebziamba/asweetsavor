_“Do not stare at me because I am black,_ _For the sun has burned me.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:6_

After her fellowship in the King’s chambers, the Shulammite became manifested among the daughters of Jerusalem. This happens also in our experience when the brothers and sisters begin to notice that something has changed in us, that we are different because of our time with the Lord. However, the seeker’s feeling is, “Do not stare at me.” She feels she is too ugly to be looked at. She could tell others about the beauty of the Lord, and she could also tell them about her shamefulness before the Lord, but at this point she realizes that she is fallen, black, and vulnerable, so she seeks to remain hidden.
