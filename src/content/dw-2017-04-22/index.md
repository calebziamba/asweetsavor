_Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord._ _– Genesis 13:18_

The more we walk this way, living a life of the tent, not being settled on the earth, and following His leading, the closer and sweeter our experience of the Lord becomes.

We should be simple and tell the Lord, “I will live a life of the tent and enjoy Your provision—Your strength, Your house, and Your fellowship. Through Your provision I will walk in Your way, living a life of the tent. I will go anywhere You lead.” Then God will have a way with us.
