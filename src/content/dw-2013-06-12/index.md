Why do people grow so differently? You might say that it is because of their different functions and gifts. Perhaps that is true. But I would say that personality is the key. They have received the same help, had the same amount of experience in serving, pursued in the same way, had the same loving heart and zeal, and labored in the same manner. Whether or not they can become proper vessels has to do with their personality.

We must know the aspects of personality that are useful to the Lord. Our personality is so valuable that it becomes the decisive factor in how the Lord will use us.

Our personality is constituted with our inborn nature and our acquired constitution. The acquired constitution is related to our environment.
