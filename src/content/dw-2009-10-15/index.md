_Feed My lambs....Shepherd My sheep....Feed My Sheep. —John 21:17, 18, 19_

One lamb can take care of another lamb. Surely there are some lambs in the Body life for us to feed. Often we think that our problem is ourselves, but the real problem is that we don't have a lamb to care for. We need to say, “Lord, I'm so thankful that I can enjoy You as life. Now the life within me demands a new living. I realize that You have brought me into the Body of Christ and have given me three commissions. Lord, I want to be faithful to Your commissions.”

What are these three commissions? First, we should love one another and give ourselves to one another. Second, we should keep the oneness. We should care only for oneness and not for doctrines and practices. And third, we should feed and shepherd someone. We all have to learn how to feed and shepherd others.
