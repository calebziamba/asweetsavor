_“You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse;_ _You have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes,_ _With one strand of your necklace.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:9_

Such a response ravishes the Lord’s heart. Previously, the Shulammite made a great show of pursuing the Lord, yet the Lord compared her to a mare. Here she says nothing, yet the Lord says she has ravished His heart.
