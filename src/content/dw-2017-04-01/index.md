_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going._ _– Hebrews 11:8_

In our experience, God’s appearing is often unclear and beyond our reasoning, yet we cannot deny we have touched something real.
