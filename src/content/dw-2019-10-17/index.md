_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

Carrying out practical things spiritually is very precious to God. For example, we may come together with others to plan a gospel meeting. We consider matters such as who should be invited, who should speak, which songs should be used, how the seating should be arranged, and so on. These are practical matters, not spiritual. We must, however, carry out these practical matters spiritually.

The first thing to do in preparing for this gospel meeting is to pray, “O Lord, have mercy on our unsaved friends. Have mercy on us as we carry out this event.” We need a lot of prayer, fasting, and fellowship in order to carry out all the details spiritually. Before the meeting, everyone should learn to pray and enjoy the gospel verses. We should train others to pray and give testimonies during the meeting. We should encourage some to spend time with the newly saved ones after the meeting. Eventually, everyone is brought into a spiritual exercise. The highest value of the gospel meeting is not the success of the meeting itself but that the entire church becomes revitalized and bears more spiritual weight.
