You may think that equipping is simply a matter of reading the Bible. In fact, it is your heart that has to be equipped first. Without a proper heart, it is useless to talk about equipping.

First of all, you have to equip your emotion. You must be continually touching the Lord. The more you love the Lord, the better. Second, you must allow the Lord to equip your mind and your will. If you allow the life-giving Spirit to constantly give you life, you will have a healthy mind and a strong will.

Remember, the world seeks to match who you are. Therefore you must equip your heart. That is, you must equip your emotion, mind, and will. You must build your emotion, mind, and will into a “wall.” In other words, you must exercise your heart to the extent that you love nothing other than the Lord and His church, think of nothing but Christ and His economy, and choose nothing other than what benefits the Lord and the saints. Then, by God’s mercy, your heart is truly equipped.
