_Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ. — First Corinthians 11:1_

Our brother Witness Lee knows the Bible by heart. Can I say the same? My constitution cannot compare to his. He is rich in revelation. By the Lord’s mercy and with Brother Lee’s help, I have received revelation and touched the central vision, but not as richly as he has. He is so richly equipped in the truth; in comparison to him I feel what I possess is but a fragment.

He has often shown us his Bible. It is filled with notes. Once, when with the young people, he opened his Bible and showed them how full of notes it was. He encouraged us to likewise become familiar with the Bible, as he is so familiar with it.
