_“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2, KJV_

The first words from the Shulammite’s mouth in this book are, “Let him.” She does not tell us who this “him” is because to her there is simply no need to do so; there is only one “him”—the king she loves, the one who fills her heart.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 19.
