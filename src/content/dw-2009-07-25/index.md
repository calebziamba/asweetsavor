When we speak, who we are goes on display. Our being, our disposition, our amount of learning, and the extent of our vision will all be exposed to those who hear us. It is easy to try to make a good impression or to avoid offending others. If this is our concern, however, we will not be someone who can speak for the Lord.

If we go to a place and speak in such a way that we might be invited again, that indicates we have fallen prey to the lust of our religious flesh. The desire to be invited again is something many ministering brothers unconsciously lust after. It is possible that we might seek manifestation and effectiveness in our speaking for the wrong reasons. We must be conscious of this and seek to avoid it. May the Lord be merciful!
