_He said, “Who are you?” She answered, “I am Ruth your maid. Spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative.” — Ruth 3:8-9_

Ruth was saying, “Boaz, you recognized that I had come to take refuge under Jehovah’s wing. That wing is your wing. Therefore, take your maidservant under your wing.”

Boaz responded, “I will do all that you ask. Have no fear. Your gamble was safe with me, for you are right. I am your close relative. You think you are blessed, but actually you are becoming a blessing to me.”
