_The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, “Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.”_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

Faith is amazing. Real faith is not based on an emotional stirring or logical reasoning. If it were, after the stirring and reasoning disappear, faith would seemingly be gone.

One day God appeared to Abraham in Ur and said, “Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you” (Acts 7:3). God told him to leave his country, but He didn’t tell him where he was to go.
