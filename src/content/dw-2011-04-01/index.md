_I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints. — Ephesians 1:18_

It is my dream to be inherited by the Lord, so I come to the Lord and tell Him, “I give all I have to You.” However, I eventually learn that much of what I have the Lord cannot take as His inheritance. In fact, the Lord cannot even take me! He loves me, cares for me, and works with me, but He desires that I “grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ” (Eph. 4:15). Then I will perfectly match Christ and become God’s inheritance.
