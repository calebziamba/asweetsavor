We should enjoy Christ as the true vine. In John 15:1 the Lord says,

_I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser._

This is a famous verse, but very few understand it. Christ is not only the vine itself; He is also the very life of the vine. There is an organic union between us, who are the branches within the vine, and Christ, who is the life of the vine.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 94.
