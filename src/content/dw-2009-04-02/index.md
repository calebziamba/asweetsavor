_Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers...And the fourth river is the Euphrates. â€” Genesis 2:10, 14b_

Sometimes a brother has a burden that the saints would get into a certain topic or use a particular type of material. He may even say that this is in the flow. However, if this burden is carried out by way of compulsion or requirement, it cannot be called the flow.

If this brother shepherds the saints in love, he should understand the principles of the divine stream with its four branches. First, the saints have the freedom in the Spirit. Second, the saints also have weakness and failure. Third, everything should be done with God's economy in view. Realizing these principles, he operates in a way that manifests Christ's sweet cherishing and his burden can be carried out in a manner that meets the needs of the saints.
