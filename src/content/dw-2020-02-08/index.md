_"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord...."  
\- Philippians 3:1  
_

If we know Jesus as Paul knew Jesus, we would surely be a rejoicing people. Paul writes this word to us to let us know that if we are not experiencing such joy, then we have not yet laid hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 178.
