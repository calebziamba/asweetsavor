_I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. —Romans 12:1_ It may be easy to understand what it is to serve intelligently, logically, and rationally. But what is it to serve in harmony with the highest reason? To come to the meeting for Christ and not for yourself—this is to serve in harmony with the highest reason. We should listen to messages and receive the riches, not for ourselves but for Christ. This is the highest reason.
