_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

A proper seed must have these three aspects. First, a seed is hidden. This is the hardest lesson of all for us to learn. We all like to be manifested. We all like to be appreciated. We all like to be somebody. But when the Lord came, He told us, “If you desire to follow Me, you must be as a grain of wheat. You must fall into the ground and die.”

We must be a seed. We must be hidden. Then while we are hidden, day in and day out, we should learn to enjoy the Lord’s presence. And while we are enjoying the Lord’s presence and are full of life, we should also say, “Lord, I’m ready to grow and to bear fruit.” Every opportunity that comes, we take it. This is to be a seed.
