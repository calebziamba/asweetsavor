_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

Whenever we lose the sweetness of our relationship with the Lord, we have fallen. If we lose our first love toward the Lord, we cannot tell others we have the song of songs. If our focus becomes our serving life or our need to be equipped in the truth instead of the Lord Himself, then we have lost our song of songs, for other things, even good and necessary things, have taken His place. Only if we live before the Lord can we tell others that we have the song of songs.
