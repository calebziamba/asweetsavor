_For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me. — Philippians 1:6-7_

If you only care for the needs of your local church without having the apostle in your heart, all the grace that the apostle receives for the churches’ nourishment will not become your nourishment. You need to be with the apostles as they are experiencing this grace. Because the saints in Philippi had the apostles in their hearts, they were able to participate in the grace that Paul enjoyed in his defense and confirmation of the gospel.
