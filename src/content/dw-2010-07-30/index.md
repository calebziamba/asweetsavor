_Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."

And Moses built an altar and named it “The Lord is My Banner.” — Exodus 17:14-15

_From the day we begin to wholly pursue Christ, we raise up Christ as our a banner, declaring that He alone is our focus and boast. He is our unique center. Suppose we all raise up such a banner. Then we would not care about anything except loving Jesus, honoring Jesus, and exalting Jesus. When we exalt this name, we declare that from this day forward our life is for Christ alone.
