_You will pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me, For You are my strength. Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have ransomed me, O Lord, God of truth. — Psalm 31:4-5_

David’s initial move to Ziph, then En Gedi, and then Paran was actually three steps down. Outwardly, everything had been cut off. He had little security or comfort. However, inwardly he was learning to trust the Lord for his salvation. After he had learned this lesson, the Lord brought him to Ziph once again (1 Sam. 26:1–2).

The first time David entered Ziph, he was a fugitive. Now he was different. He had confidence in the Lord. I hope all of us would experience Christian growth in such a way.
