Your speaking should also be in harmony with the truth and the content of what you minister. A brother may use a low example to express a high truth, and in so doing cheapen his message. The value of that message will be lost. Another brother might have a lofty burden, but may not have the utterance to match his burden. His utterance will turn out to be either weak or inaccurate with regard to his burden. As a result, his prophesying will not be effective.

For example, a brother may give a message about confessing sin, saying that everyone has sin, that we are in bondage to sin, that no one can overcome sin, and that the law of sin operates in everyone. If while speaking on this serious topic, he utters a joke and causes everyone to laugh as a means of “comic relief,” it will hurt his ministering. This is an example of someone's utterance not being in harmony with the burden of his message.
