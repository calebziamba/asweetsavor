_Having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions. — Colossians 2:12-13_ Paul warned the saints in Colossae to beware of the elements of the world and the traditions of men. He also told them that they needed to realize that they are not only buried, but also raised up together with Christ (2:12-13). Therefore, no believer needs to abide in such things as what not to touch, what not to eat, or what days to observe (2:16, 20-22).

The Colossian believers used to be under the rule of what God had ordained in the past, but now they had entered into resurrection. When I am in resurrection, everything is under my feet. Why should I keep this practice or that law? Christ is in charge now, and I am with Him in His resurrection. How Christ now rules is how I rule. How Christ exercises is how I exercise. Such a living matches Christ’s desire.
