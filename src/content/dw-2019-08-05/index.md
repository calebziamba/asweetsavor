_“If you yourself do not know,_ _Most beautiful among women,_ _Go forth on the trail of the flock_ _And pasture your young goats_ _By the tents of the shepherds.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:8_

When we begin following the Lord, we often go astray by mixing other things in with our love of the Lord. Even our pursuing of Christ can become mixed up with some kind of work. Therefore we must go forth in the footsteps of the flock, which is the way of life. In our following of the Lord we will never have to face situations that no one has confronted before. Thus, we can often experience a breakthrough by receiving the riches of those who have passed on in this way before us.
