> \- 1 Corinthians 3:16

What a rest you should have when you realize that you possess this eternal life. There is no need to make an effort to find God, for He is here already. Neither need you make any effort to run from God, for you cannot. And He knows everything about you, therefore He knows how to create whatever you need. The eternal life we possess is such a wonderful Person.
