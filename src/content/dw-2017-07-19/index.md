_But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come._ _– John 16:13_

We need to have a deep realization that God is Spirit, and thus if we want to worship Him, we must worship Him in spirit. The Spirit we enjoy is the Spirit of truth, who is bringing us into all the reality of what God is (John 16:13). He is also unveiling all the riches of Christ to us, which are in our spirit, where there is no ritual, form, or religious practice. In our spirit we enjoy a living person.
