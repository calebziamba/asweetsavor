When Adam fell, God drove him from the garden of Eden. When Cain slew Abel, God drove him from His presence. When the sons of God mixed with the daughters of men, God sent the flood. Godâ€™s way at that time was to remove the offenders. Today, God no longer drives sinners away but draws them to Himself (John 12:32).
