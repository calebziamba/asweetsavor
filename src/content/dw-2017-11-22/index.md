_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

We must guard against such spots. It is so easy for impurity to come in. When we were first saved, this was not our case. We should be in fear and trembling, for it is too easy to lose our focus on Jesus only and begin to live for self-gain. Are we able to declare, “Lord Jesus, I am Yours, and I live for Your satisfaction alone”? This must be our stand.
