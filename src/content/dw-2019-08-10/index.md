_“And pasture your young goats_ _By the tents of the shepherds.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:8_

If we love the Lord and wish to follow Him in life, we must receive the experiences left for us by those who have gone before us. If we truly love the Lord, we cannot separate ourselves from the shepherds. We should recognize those whom the Lord has placed among us as shepherds. Then, we simply pasture our young goats by the shepherds’ tents.
