_“Please let us fall into the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”_ _– Second Samuel 24:14_

God gave David three options for punishment—seven years of famine, three months fleeing from his enemies, or three days of plague. David simply said, “Please let us fall into the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man” (v. 14).

Therefore, God caused a plague among the people that eventually killed seventy thousand. An angel appeared at the threshing floor of Ornan. David hurried to buy that threshing floor, built an altar there, and sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord. The Lord heeded David’s actions and withdrew the plague from the land.
