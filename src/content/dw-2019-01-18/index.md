_So \[Isaac\] built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.  
__– Genesis 26:25_

The altar and tent go together. Those who have met God and offered themselves to Him live a life of the altar and tent. Like Abraham, they look for “the city which has foundations.” A consecrated person lives for God’s testimony and the benefit of the church. Such a life is not settled. It is a wandering life.
