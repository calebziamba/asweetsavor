The eighth factor for Paul’s approvedness was his ability to teach, as indicated in his word to the elders of the church in Ephesus:

_“How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house.”_ _– Acts 20:20_

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 150.
