_The Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him._ _– Genesis 12:7_

The more God appears to us, the more we experience His provision and supply, but His appearing is not necessarily followed by our building an altar. We can live a life of the altar only when God appears to us in a proper place. When God appeared to Abraham in Ur, he didn’t build an altar. When God appeared to him in Haran, he didn’t build an altar either. However, when God appeared to him in Shechem, Abraham built an altar. It is God’s provision, not His appearing, that produces the altar.

When we have God’s provision, we will consecrate ourselves to Him. God’s appearing enables us to walk the way of God and His provision enables us to consecrate ourselves to Him.
