> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
> 
> \- Romans 10:13

Learn to call in all different manners. Sometimes we need to call sweetly with affection, telling the Lord how we love Him. When you are provoked by your situation or frustrated by some limitation, you need to call strongly. Call with sighing when you are convicted under the Lord’s shining or when confronted with a problem which is beyond you. Learn to exercise in this way, whether by yourself or with the saints. If you call for even just one or two minutes, you will sense a real washing and refreshing.
