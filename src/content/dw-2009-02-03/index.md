_And a river went forth from Eden to water the whole garden, and from there it divided and became four branches. The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. â€” Genesis 2:11-12_

As this unique river flows from the garden to the earth, it branches out along four lines. The first branch mentioned is Pishon, which means "flowing freely." This river Pishon flows around the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold...

Pishon flows around the land of Havilah, which in Hebrew means "causing growth." What does this land of Havilah, this land of growth, produce? First, it produces gold (Gen. 2:12), which signifies God the Father's divine nature. The Bible emphasizes that the gold of this land is good, which means it is very pure. When this river flows, something pure is produced, which is actually the nature of God Himself.
