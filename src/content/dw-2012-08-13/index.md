_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

A healthy church should come up from the wilderness. The saints should realize that we are waiting for the Lord’s return. Those with the Lord’s return in view desire nothing of this world.

If there are many in a certain church who are coming up from the wilderness, surely that entire church will come up from the wilderness. May the Lord bless us so that we may come up from the wilderness into His rest.
