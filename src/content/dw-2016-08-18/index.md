Even if we have a good personality, it might be destroyed in the church life. For example, one brother just begins to love the Lord, and another older brother invites him to enjoy some worldly entertainment. This older brother hasnâ€™t sanctified himself for the sake of the younger brother. On the contrary, he is destroying the young one with his knowledge that the worldly entertainment is nothing.
