_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

The Song of Songs also reminds us that we are not yet spiritually mature; rather, we must continually give ourselves to the Lord and renew our consecration to Him so that He can take us on stage by stage.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 12.
