_This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you. â€” John 15:12_

Now that we are in the Body of Christ, we should realize that the Lord requires something from us. The result of our being born again does involve some responsibility. Now that we are in the Body of Christ, we should not focus only on ourselves. The Gospel of John reveals that Christ has three commissions for us. But these three commissions are not heavy requirements for us. Rather, they issue out of our enjoyment of all the riches of Christ that we have covered previously.
