_For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death — Romans 8:2_

Formerly we were in death, but by being born again we are set free from death (Rom. 8:2). Before we were born again, we lived under the power of death. The prospect of physical death caused us to be in fear (Heb. 2:15), and the death element within us caused us to live a life according to the prince of the world, Satan. We had death within and death without.

Do you realize that the all-inclusive death of Christ has destroyed Satan? Moreover, through His resurrection Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, who gave us the eternal life the moment we believed. Now we enjoy “the law of the Spirit of life.” We are released from the law of sin and death by being in Christ Jesus.
