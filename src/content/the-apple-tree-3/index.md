> Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,  
> So is my beloved among the young men.  
> In his shade I took great delight and sat down,  
> And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
> 
> \- Song of Songs 2:3

Brothers and sisters, when you first began to follow the Lord, what you longed for was merely the feeling of the Lordâ€™s presence, for some speaking, some leading, and some enlightenment. Your actual enjoyment of life at that time was still very limited. One day, however, through the work of the cross and the help of the church, you were enlarged and able to break through your limitations to enter into a fuller enjoyment of the divine life.
