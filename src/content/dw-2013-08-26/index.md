_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?”_

_“My beloved extended his hand through the opening,_ _And my feelings were aroused for him.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:3-4_

Without our realizing it, when we were on top of everything in the heavenly realm, our vision of the cross faded away. Nonetheless, the Lord at this point places His hand into the opening of our door. Praise the Lord that we still have an opening! Our heart is awake. We still love the Lord, and deep within us we still have a place for us to meet Him. Although we are full of excitement and enjoyment and joy as one standing on the peak of spiritual experience, we still have an opening for the Lord to display His hand. When we see His hand, our protests dissolve.

It may take a long time, however, for us both to experience and answer His call. Perhaps the Lord has asked us to open for Him several times, but we have not been able to respond. Deep within us, we know the Lord has a request for us. We know He is asking us to carry the cross. We just cannot understand the reason.
