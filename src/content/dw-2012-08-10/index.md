_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

We owe our separation to the Spirit’s working, which enables us to bear such a living testimony before men. However, there is no need for us to bear such testimony to ourselves; others will bear witness that we are coming up from the wilderness. What should absorb us is simply to walk this pathway unto the end.

May we have the Lord’s mercy to see that the world is a wilderness, where our efforts will only result in useless wandering. Although we are in the world, we should not be of it; we should be those who are coming up from the wilderness. God alone must be the center of our life, for all else is meaningless.
