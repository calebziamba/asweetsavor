> For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:20 NASB

Our citizenship is in heaven. Therefore, we are not an earthly people. Paul told us that even though many walk in a manner that leads to degradation, our citizenship exists in heaven. Be encouragedâ€”we are a group of heavenly people! Our life, living, and labor are heavenly. Many may walk in a way that causes us to grieve like Paul, but our citizenship remains in heaven.
