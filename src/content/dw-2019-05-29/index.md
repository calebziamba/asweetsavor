_“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

Brothers and sisters, when we serve together with others without touching the Lord ourselves, our service may keep us occupied, but we will not know much genuine companionship with those who serve with us. However, if we do touch the Lord as we serve, we will find many saints who love the Lord as we do, and we will appreciate them as the virgins who are our companions.
