We must realize that it is possible for us, after we are born again, to lose the practical reality of our new birth. That is, while we still have the new life within us, we may not have a new living. This does not mean that we have lost our salvation, but that we are not living according to the new life we have received.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 69.
