_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

Our initial vision is our foundation for following the Lord. Rather than replacing this foundational vision, every further appearance of the Lord builds upon and expands it. Take Abraham for example. The first time God appeared to him, He spoke of the land, saying, “Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you” (Acts 7:3). The second time God appeared, He spoke of the land again but added, “I will bless you, and make your name great; and so you shall be a blessing” (Gen. 12:2). Since the land was Abraham’s first vision, it was the foundation for the blessing of the second vision.
