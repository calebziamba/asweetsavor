The New Testament is filled with examples of local churches. Acts 8:1 says, “And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem.” Paul wrote to “the church of God which is at Corinth” (1 Cor. 1:2), and the apostle John was told to “write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea” (Rev. 1:11). God’s wisdom is shown in His placing us in local churches to live a church life together. All regenerated believers belong to the body of Christ and to the local church in their locality.
