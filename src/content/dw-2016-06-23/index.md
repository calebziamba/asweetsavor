By being born again, we have been seated in Christ Jesus in the heavenlies, the highest place in the universe. This is because we are one with Christ not only in His resurrection, but also in His ascension. Many Christians are waiting to go to heaven, but the Bible tells us we have already been seated in the heavenly places with Christ! Ephesians 2:6 tells us,

_\[God\] raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus._
