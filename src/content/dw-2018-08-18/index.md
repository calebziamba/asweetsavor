A church life is real and sweet, but not perfect. In fact, a sweet church life is an imperfect church life! Someone may say, “Praise the Lord! Our church life is so wonderful, and the cooperation among the saints is so good and sweet!” Though this statement may be true, such experiences will not last very long. Our experience of a truly sweet church life is when the church is not perfect.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 17.
