_The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown._ _– Genesis 6:2, 4_

Man fell in Adam, and that fall continued. It reached its lowest point with the mixture of spirit and flesh.  The mixture of the sons of God (fallen angels, Jude 6–7) with the daughters of men produced the Nephilim, or giants, the mighty men of renown.
