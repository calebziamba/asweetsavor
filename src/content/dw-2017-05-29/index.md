How do we enter into the enjoyment of Christ, which is in the Spirit of truth? John 4:24 (NKJV) says,

_God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth._

In this verse, the Lord Jesus says something quite striking. He tells us that God is not in the physical realm, nor is He in the realm of the mind. According to the Lord Jesus, God is in the realm of the Spirit, for He is Spirit. Therefore, if we want to worship God, we need to worship Him in spirit.
