The book of Ruth is one of the sweetest in the entire Bible. This revised edition of _Ruth: Growth unto Maturity_, by Titus Chu, shows that the story of Ruth the Moabitess and her marriage to Boaz is a picture of how we, who are sinners, can have a turn from our fallen situation to enter into complete union and rest with Christ.
