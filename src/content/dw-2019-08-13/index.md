_“To me, my darling, you are like My mare among the chariots of Pharaoh. Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, Your neck with strings of beads.” – Song of Songs 1:9-10_

Actually, we are all good at making such ornaments. We know if we proclaim something in a certain way we will appear strong, or if we do something in a certain way we will appear to be spiritual. Therefore, saints at this stage in their spiritual life spend much time on producing such ornaments rather than pursuing the Lord. They try to exercise their will and emotion to be spiritual, as they consider it. Nonetheless, we don’t know yet how God will transform such ones, or what they will eventually express, for such outward beauty is the result of their own work; it does not come from the reality of their inward experience with the Lord.
