_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

We should be careful. We may serve God in a religious way, and encourage others to serve in that way, without even realizing it. It is hard for us to have spiritual insight, to recognize when the Lord has initiated His work in others. We may not see people as God does but only as objects for our service. This type of service will ruin others.
