_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

The Lord knows exactly what He is doing. His intention is that the plow would make long furrows in our back. A furrow is a narrow ditch plowed into the ground for growing crops. At a farm we can often see one furrow after another dug into the soil so that many different crops can grow. Spiritually speaking, when we are cut deeply by the Lord it is for us to grow in life and bear abundant fruit.

If we desire to have a rich and bountiful growth in life so that the Lord can use us as a blessing to the church, we must be willing for the Lord to cut deeply into our person. He will plow over our back until there are long furrows for growth.
