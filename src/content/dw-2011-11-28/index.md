_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

_Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14_

You have to remember that this wall is not outward but inward. For example, Brother Lee once told us frankly, “Don’t just shout in the meeting.” At the time we were releasing our spirit and singing joyfully. Why would Brother Lee ask us not to shout? Originally, that kind of shouting rendered us a lot of help. It helped us to break out of our oldness and to have rich, releasing, and satisfying meetings.

We were so thankful for the practices of pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord. They revived us and helped us to open to the Lord. Because of pray-reading and calling on the Lord’s name we were so blessed. However, Brother Lee realized that even our way of pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord could become a wall separating us from going on further with the Lord. In our enjoyment of these things, we might have just remained where we were and become reluctant to go on.
