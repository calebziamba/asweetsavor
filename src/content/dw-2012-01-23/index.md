_"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away. For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. The flowers have already appeared in the land; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land. The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away!'" — Song of Songs 2:10-13_ You may have thought that your early experiences in seeking the Lord were something of the springtime. The Lord, however, tells you that your abiding in them should be considered a time of winter. It is as if the Lord is saying, “Your experiences, your enjoyment, your supply, and your boasting should stop. The winter is past. The rain is also over and gone. You will not get the supply, nourishment, or watering if you stay in these things any longer.”
