_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Instead of going all the way with the Lord, we usually stop after taking a step or two. The Lord wants to take us higher, but we like to stay in our comfort zone.

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ,”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 116.
