_Draw me; we will run after you!_ _— The Song of Songs 1:4a_

When the Lord draws you, everyone else will also follow Him. Brothers and sisters, when you are with the virgins, you must respect your influence on others' going on. You are so crucial that when you live, everyone lives, and when you die, everyone dies.

A real lover of the Lord is bound to others. He knows that “draw me” will result in “we will run after you.” His experience before the Lord becomes the blessing of the saints, and the experience of the saints becomes his blessing. The seeker prays, “Please draw me. If You want us to follow You, You have to draw me, for if You draw me, we will all run after You.”

Brothers and sisters, the principle remains the same until the end of this book. In these eight chapters, it is always “me” and “we.” No one can experience these eight chapters alone. We need to experience all these things together with the other virgins. That is the principle of “Draw me; we will run after you.”
