_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

Suppose the Lord gives us a Christian brother to care for who is suffering under a heavy load. Others might try to get him to study the Bible with them. Due to his situation, however, he may not be able to receive such help, not having a heart to study at this time. This is where compassion comes in. When he says, “Things are so hard right now,” we should say, “I know what you mean. Let’s pray together.” Our prayer with him may even be with sighing and tears.
