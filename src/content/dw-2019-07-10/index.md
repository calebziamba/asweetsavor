_“I am black, but comely,_ _O ye daughters of Jerusalem,_ _As the tents of Kedar,_ _As the curtains of Solomon.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:5_

The seeker’s experience in the King’s chambers shows us that only when the Lord shines upon us will we realize just how black we are. When He shines upon us in a particular area of our life, we truly see that part of our being is black. Therefore, the Lord must shine upon us in all aspects of our life; only then will we realize that all that we had previously regarded as acceptable and commendable is nothing but utter blackness. Even our love to the Lord may come out of a heart that is black.
