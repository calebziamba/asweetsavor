_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

Paul talks about these different stages of transformation in Romans 12–16. Our transformation is progressive, from one level to the next and from a lower stage to a higher one. We begin our Christian life as self-centered individuals, but through transformation, we gain a healthy relationship with the saints around us. Eventually, transformation completely unites us with the saints to become the corporate testimony of Christ.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 18.
