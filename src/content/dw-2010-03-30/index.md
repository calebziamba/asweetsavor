_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

For us to serve the Lord we must be enlarged. This means that we must prepare ourselves to be plowed. Plowing begins in our “youth.” Once we begin to love the Lord His hand is already upon us in our environment. The most important thing to remember as we experience the Lord’s plowing is not to escape. We must always remind ourselves, “This is exactly where the Lord wants me.” We should not run away from where the Lord has put us.

When we are faithful to stay in the environment that He has arranged, there will be furrows in our experience. Then when people see us they will sense something of life. They won’t sense our talent or ability, even if it is there. Many young people are talented and hopeful, but they never fulfill their potential because they refuse to be plowed. If we receive the Lord’s environmental arrangement and refuse to escape from His dealing, then the Lord will plow furrows in our back. This will enlarge us so that we can become a blessing to the church.
