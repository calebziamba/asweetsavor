> Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,  
> So is my beloved among the young men.  
> In his shade I took great delight and sat down,  
> And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
> 
> – Song of Songs 2:3

In the original language, “apple” refers to a kind of fruit that comes from an evergreen plant. Here she enjoys the Lord as such a fruit that is full of life which is unlimited, and which is increasing in her all the time. Such is her enjoyment of this unlimited life that she testifies here, “How rich is the life of my Lord! How excellent He is! He is like the fruit of the evergreen among the trees of the wood.”
