_“It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.”_ _– John 6:63_

In whatever way we enjoy the Lord—by praying, praising, singing a song, reading the word, or in any other way—what we receive is life. The life we enjoy has several aspects: the bread of life to make us alive and strengthen us, the water of life to quench our thirst and refresh us, the light of life to shine for our daily walk, and the word of life to energize us. This is wonderful! Praise the Lord that we can enjoy Him as life, the One with all of these riches to meet our daily needs!
