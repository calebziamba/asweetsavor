_"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_

If the Lord only asked us to pick up our cross and follow Him, it would be too hard for us. Praise Him! Although we must experience the cross, we do so with the experience of the abundant life of resurrection. We experience the cross, but we experience it with resurrection! When we face hardship, we have the assurance that the resurrected Lord is faithful. When we suffer the blow that brings us into the experience of His death, we also experience Him in His resurrection. We cannot be in one without the other. We are not only in the clefts of the rock but also in the covert of the precipice.

To follow Him in this way is to come all the way from the banqueting house to the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice, and to grow from abiding in some enjoyment of the Lord’s riches into actual union with Him.
