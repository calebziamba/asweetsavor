_“You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse;_ _You have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes,_ _With one strand of your necklace.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:9_

The seeker’s obedience here comes naturally; she simply looks at the Lord. Her glance seems to tell Him, “Lord, I am with You. I respond to You whenever You call; your wish is my command. I am here. I don’t want to hurt You or hinder You anymore. I don’t want to have any disagreement with You. I am willing to put aside all I have that Your desire might be fulfilled.”

The Lord is deeply moved. He says, “You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.” His heart is touched because she answers His call to enter into His ascension; when the Lord calls her to go with Him, she simply obeys.
