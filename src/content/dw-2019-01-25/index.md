_So \[Isaac\] built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.  
__– Genesis 26:25_

Whenever we begin to view a work as our own possession and when we begin to view those we serve as our assets, we have given up the life of the tent and have become settled. This is shameful! We shouldn’t use people for our own ministry or work. No! Our ministry is for the church; the church is not for our ministry.  
  
Christian workers are for the church; the church is not for the workers (1 Cor. 3:22). A life of the tent means that we don’t seek anything for ourselves. It makes us pure and clean. Because we are not settled, we cannot gain anything for ourselves.
