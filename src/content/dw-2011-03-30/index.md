_Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth—in Him. — Ephesians 1:9-10_ We may take pleasure in music, studies, or being naughty, but these are all temporary. God has an eternal pleasure, and this pleasure involves us. In eternity He will still take pleasure in us. The Father never tires of the Son; neither does He tire of us in Him. Together we become His pleasure which He purposed in Himself.

My grandchildren are my heart’s good pleasure. When I see them, I am so satisfied. In the same manner, nothing brings greater satisfaction to the heart of our Father than to see His glorious inheritance in His many sons.
