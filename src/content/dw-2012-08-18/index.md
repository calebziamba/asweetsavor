_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

We are not required to pay a price to gain the experiences of the first stage. Even the experience of having the plaits of gold with studs of silver is something done for us that results in our own beautification. But in this second stage, the seeking one realizes that a price must be paid if she wants to follow the Lord.

Her love for Him will not leave her untouched any longer, for from this point onward He will touch every aspect of her living.
