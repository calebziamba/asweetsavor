_Until the cool of the day When the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense. — Song of Songs 4:6_

After the Lord praises His seeker, she has a hunger deep within, so she says, “Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, I, for my part, will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.”

She realizes that she is not yet perfected. She desires to go on in her experience, so she is willing to go to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense. In other words, she is willing to walk the way of the cross, so that by it she may have a deeper union with the Lord.
