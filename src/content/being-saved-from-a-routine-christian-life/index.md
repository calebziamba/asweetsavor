This excerpt is taken from the July 2016 Summer Vision Week training in Cleveland, OH. This training was focused on the Golden Lampstand of the Tabernacle, as described in Exodus chapter 25. In this excerpt, brother Titus shares on the significance of the lampstand's almond cups, bulbs, and flowers; how they show that the Lord will work in our life to save us from our routine so that we can grow in Christ to bear the Lord's testimony.
