_He who has the bride is the bridegroom._ _– John 3:29a_

May we all tell the Lord how much we love Him and enjoy Him!

_I love You, Lord! In the whole universe I don’t want to care for anyone or anything else. I only want to care for You. Lord, may You gain me completely for Yourself. Thank You for all that You are to me! Thank You that I can know You and enjoy You as such a wonderful living person!_
