> Not that I have already obtained the prize , or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession of it , seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus .Â

It is hard to imagine that anyone else in church history could have been more deserving of the out-resurrection than Paul. Even so he still struggled to pursue Christ, because the riches of Christ are unsearchable.
