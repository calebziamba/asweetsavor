_Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.” Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the Lord is with you.” – Second Samuel 7:1-3_

In the New Testament, Stephen says, “The Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says: ‘Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What house will you build for Me? says the Lord, or what is the place of My rest?” (Acts 7:48–49).

God was too big for any temple David could build for Him. However, He appreciated David’s desire to provide Him a home among His people in Jerusalem.
