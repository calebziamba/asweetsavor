Paul was commissioned by the Lord to turn people from “the dominion of Satan to God” (Acts 26:18). Of course, everyone likes to think that they belong to themselves and are under their own authority. They believe that they can live their own lives on their own terms. According to the Bible, however, no one is under his own authority. Everyone is in either the kingdom of Satan or the kingdom of God.

If you are born again, you have entered God’s kingdom and have been brought under God’s authority, but if you are not born again, then you are under Satan’s authority. You may think that you are your own master, but actually you are in Satan’s kingdom. This is true no matter who you are, where you live, or what you do. Every human being who does not believe in the Lord Jesus is under the authority of Satan. This was also our position before we were born again.
