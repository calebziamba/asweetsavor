_“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.” — Joshua 1:2-3_

I marvel at the foolishness of some Christians. There is so much God has given them in Christ, yet they forget Christ in their daily concerns. They are consumed with working toward a degree or seeking a job. They worry that even though they have sent off so many résumés, still no one has hired them.

When I pray for such ones, I pray that in the midst of their job search they would love the Lord, love the church, consecrate themselves to Jesus Christ and nothing else, and that they would wrestle the evil powers for the sake of the Lord’s kingdom by walking in Christ.
