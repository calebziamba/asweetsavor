_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves. Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others._ _— Philippians 2:3-4_

_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _— First Corinthians 3:6_

As we begin to regard others as more important than ourselves, we no longer consider only what we are able to do, but now we also begin to appreciate what others are able do. When we look at the nearby churches, we value the work of all those who are serving. When we look at our own church, we see how those with us are serving according to their God-given portion. Do we have something of value ourselves? We certainly do, yet now we are also able to value the qualities that others possess.
