_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

Religious people attract us because we ourselves are religious. We want someone to tell us what to do, thinking that by listening to what they say and doing it, the religious need in us will be satisfied, and we will find rest. This is why we respond to religion.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 180.
