_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1_

It is God’s desire that we know Him as our portion. In calling us, He laid hold of us. Now He wants us to “lay hold of that for which also \[we were\] laid hold of by Christ Jesus” (Phil. 3:12). We should not focus on any difficulty as we follow Christ, for Christ Himself is our portion.
