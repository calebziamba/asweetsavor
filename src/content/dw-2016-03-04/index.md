_The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown._ _– Genesis 6:2, 4_

Without Christ we will look for outward things to rely on. We shouldn’t seek to become “mighty men of renown,” looking for outward results or praise from others. We should only pay attention to the Christ within us. The early disciples had nothing to rely upon but Christ, even proclaiming, “I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—walk!” (Acts 3:6). This is not an easy way, but it is the way of salvation.
