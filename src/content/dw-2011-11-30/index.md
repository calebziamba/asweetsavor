_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

_Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14_

If you really desire to follow the Lord, you have to come before Him often and ask, “Is there a wall between us? If there is one, please break it down completely. Even if it is the highest experience, the sweetest feeling, or the largest work, I do not want it. I would rather throw it away so that there is no wall between us.”
