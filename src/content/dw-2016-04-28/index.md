_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose._ _â€”Philippians 2:2_

We should insist on nothing but Christ. If we are all focused on Him, even though we may not all be doing the same things outwardly, we are of the same mind, for we are all following the Lord. For instance, Paul encourages us to pray (1 Tim. 2:8, 1 Thess. 5:17), but this can take different forms. How loudly should we pray? Should everybody participate at the same time? Should we stand, sit, or kneel as we pray? What is the right way? The right way is to focus on Christ, follow His lead, and allow others to do the same.
