The Lord Jesus said, "For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them" (Matthew 18:20, NKJV). This verse is often used to define the church: a gathering of at least two or three believers in the name of Christ. In this excerpt from the fourth meeting of the Memorial Day Conference, brother Titus shares that this verse comes directly after Matthew 18:19, in which Jesus says, "I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven."

Two or three gathered together in the Lord's name may be the church, but how do they lay hold of the reality of the church? It is not by meetings, but by meeting together with a clear purpose, aim, and direction.

The title of this conference, based on Romans 11:33, was, "Oh! The Depth of the Riches, Both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God!" The conference was held in Cleveland, Ohio.
