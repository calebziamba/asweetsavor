_“I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.’” — Song of Songs 5:2_

Although the Shulammite has truly grown in life, she has still not achieved the state of perfection, so she still has to go forward. She needs more of the work of the cross. Therefore the Lord is knocking and asking her to pay yet a higher price. Though she sleeps, her heart is aware that the Lord is knocking. She is not completely separated from the Lord in her sleep.
