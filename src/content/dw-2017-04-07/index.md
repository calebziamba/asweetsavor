_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going._ _– Hebrews 11:8_

Our walk in faith is according to His appearing. There is something mysterious yet undeniable about the Lord’s appearing and our resulting faith. Without knowing it, we are growing and advancing. How wonderful is this life of faith!
