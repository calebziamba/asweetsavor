_“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse;_ _A spring shut up, a fountain sealed._ _Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates_ _With choice fruits, henna with nard plants,_ _Nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,_ _With all the trees of frankincense,_ _Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:12-14_

In addition to being an enclosed garden, you are also “a spring shut up.” This means that you are always bubbling with the enjoyment of life before the Lord.

You are also “a fountain sealed.” Not only are you beautiful, enjoyable, fresh, and new; you are also full of life. The Lord looks at you and finds that you have so many “rods” and “shoots.” There are so many things sprouting up from you. The Lord finds in you a recovered paradise!

How is it that the Lord’s paradise can be recovered? The secret is the pomegranate. The pomegranate tree is full of life. If you break open its fruit, you will see that it is full of seeds and juice. Rods and shoots indicate the abundance of life.
