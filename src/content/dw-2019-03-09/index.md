_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

How did the father-child relationship between Paul and Timothy develop? Paul never traveled around with a banner that said, “I am an apostle looking for a child to raise up and then send to different churches.” When Paul passed through Lystra and Iconium, Timothy was recommended to him, and he agreed to take him. A mutual life relationship developed as they spent time together.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, pages 159-160.
