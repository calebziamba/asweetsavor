_“I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.” — Song of Songs 2:1_

After the seeker sees the church and experiences the riches in life, she testifies, “I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys” (2:1). The rose here could be considered as a kind of wild lily, which is actually a scorned flower. A lily in the valleys is also ordinary and unassuming. Sharon represents the plain where God pastures His flock. The Lord has become equally precious to her whether she is at ease or in suffering, for the Lord is just as precious to her when she is in the pasture as when she is in the valleys. When she is at ease, she is a rose of Sharon. When she is suffering, she is a lily of the valleys. No matter whether she is at ease or in suffering, she knows that God is shepherding her and caring for her.
