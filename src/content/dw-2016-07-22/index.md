A serving one should be fine. He must be fine in his serving and administrating in the church life. However, if a fine person does not continually experience transformation in his nature, eventually he will become very picky. If there is no divine nature in your fineness, and if you donâ€™t have a good character developed from the divine nature, you will become a problem in the church life, for you will bring the saints under a good deal of pressure.
