_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

There is something in our blood that seeks assurance that we are right. When we feel we are doing what we should for God, we feel at rest. The problem is that in religion, there is only “I am right and you are wrong.”

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 179.
