> "for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and _also_ for the _life_ to come."
> 
> 1 Timothy 4:8 NASB

Godly exercise is good for your spirit, it is good for your soul, it is good for your body, it is good for the church life, it is good for family life. It is good for your studies, it is good for your career, it is good for your relationship with your colleagues. It is good for the gospel, it is good for edifying the saints, it is good for raising up the new ones, it is good for functioning. Everything is included, just in one thing: godly exercise.
