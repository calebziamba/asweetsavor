_And Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech._ _–  Genesis 5:25_

Lamech means “the wild man” (Easton). We need to be crazy for Christ and the church! We shouldn’t be afraid to use the sword of the Spirit to pierce even to the dividing of soul and spirit (Heb. 4:12). May we all be beside ourselves for the Lord’s desire. May we be so crazy that we cannot eat or drink until His will is done.
