> _“Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are differences of operation, but it is the same God who operates all things in all.”_

> _(1 Corinthians 12:4-6)_

Gifted doesn't mean much in itself because as long as you are saved, you're gifted, am I right? You need the Lordship. Why? Because the gifts need to produce ministry. The Spirit comes from the Lord, right? How do you make the gift to be a ministry? You have to shift from merely a gift to the Lord’s lordship.
