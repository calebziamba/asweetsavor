_Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires._ _– Galatians 5:24_

_But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world._ _– Galatians 6:14_

We all have our own personalities. But our personalities can be changed. One may lose his integrity in his old age, even though he has been faithful all his life. It can happen to one who serves the Lord just as it can to anyone else in the world. One may serve the Lord for his entire life, but eventually he may reach a point where he can no longer walk this way, for his personality has changed and even deteriorated.
