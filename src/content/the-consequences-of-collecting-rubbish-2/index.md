> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8

We must be careful about what occupies us. We only have a certain amount of room in our heart. If we do not know how to count things loss, we will have less room for Christ. Things that occupy us will contaminate us and our church life. Even the best teaching, when exalted too highly, can replace Christ and become a source of contamination. It is possible for a church to be occupied with a teaching or practice to the exclusion of Christ. We should never consider that any particular Christian teaching or practice is our focus. Only Christ Himself is our focus!
