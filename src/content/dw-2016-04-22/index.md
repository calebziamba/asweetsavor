_For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them._ _– Ephesians 2:8–10_

God has no demands on man. His care, His mercy, and His blessing are all based on His faithfulness. This is the meaning of Noah’s experience. Our living is based entirely on God’s faithfulness!
