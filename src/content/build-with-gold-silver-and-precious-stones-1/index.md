Christ is the foundation and we must take heed how to build upon it. Do you want to be in the  
church life? Then take heed how to be in the church life properly: we must build on the foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones. The foundation does not change. There is a foundation, and that foundation is Christ. When we use gold, silver, and precious stones to build upon it then God is very happy.
