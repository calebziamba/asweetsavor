Try to starve God. If you try to starve yourself, you can die after three days without water and perhaps seven days without food. But if you refuse to feed the Lord for years, He will not be harmed, for He is self-existing and ever existing. If you ask, “If that is so, then why am I so weak?” then I would answer, “He creates whatever you need, and you need to be weak so that you can eventually say that it was all His mercy.”
