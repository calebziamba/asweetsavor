The Triune God operates together as the God of oneness. There are one essence, one element, one life, one nature, one existence, one living, one operation, one purpose, and one substance culminating in one universal enlargement. Praise the Lord! The Lord Jesus while on earth prayed for the reality of this universal enlargement. This enlargement is simply Christâ€™s human life being expressed through so many saints who have been regenerated and who intrinsically have the capacity to live out this oneness.
