In Genesis, after mixture was brought in through the marriage of the sons of God with the daughters of men, “the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually” (Gen. 6:5). Mixture brings in flesh, which brings in evil thoughts. Evil thoughts are those which don’t involve Christ. If our thoughts concerning money, a degree, our future, or our career are separate from Christ, these thoughts are all evil. The more we dwell on things apart from Christ, the more we are away from the presence of God.
