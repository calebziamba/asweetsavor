_“I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”_ _– Genesis. 15:1, NKJV._

Both the shield and the reward are, in reality, God Himself. Initially, we have a tiny shield, since our experience of the Lord as our reward within is so little. Gradually, as our experience of the Lord as our reward increases, our shield is enlarged. Eventually that shield will be so large that we are surrounded by it. Our whole soul—mind, emotion, and will—will be protected from spiritual attacks. No matter how people attack us, we won’t be affected or offended.
