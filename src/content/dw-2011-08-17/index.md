_The song of songs, which is Solomon’s. "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth— For your love is better than wine. Because of the fragrance of your good ointments, Your name is ointment poured forth; Therefore the virgins love you. Draw me away! We will run after you." — Song of Songs 1:1-4_

_"Refresh me with apples, For I am lovesick. His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me." — Song of Songs 2:5-6_

The seeker here has had the experience of the Lord’s kisses and has been in His chambers. She has also been through the effort of keeping her vineyard and has experienced wandering astray. She has gained the praise and admiration of the Lord. Plaits of ornaments have been made for her. She has lived in the love of the Lord and experienced the riches of life and the church life. She has also experienced living in the love of the Lord that will be with her all her life. All these experiences culminate in this union with the Lord.
