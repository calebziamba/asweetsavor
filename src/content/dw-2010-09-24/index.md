_So the closest relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” And he removed his sandal. — Ruth 4:8

Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her. — Ephesians 5:25_ The closer kinsman surrendered his right by drawing off his sandal and handing it to Boaz. This was the custom at that time. It was a confirmation, the equivalent of signing a contract today. Boaz then said, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi. Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate” (Ruth 4:9–10). Boaz was doing this not for his own sake but for Naomi and Ruth, and to perpetuate the name of Elimelech and Mahlon.

When the Lord took us upon Himself, it appears He didn’t get anything but a lot of hard work. But at least He got us. The Lord’s way is always to pour Himself out and to suffer on our behalf, that we may obtain the ultimate blessing (Eph. 5:25).
