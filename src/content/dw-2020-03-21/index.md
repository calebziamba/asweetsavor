_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle"  
\-Romans 1:1  
_

Consider Romans 16:7: “Greet Andronicus and Junias… who also were in Christ before me.” Although Paul was writing of greeting other Christians, we can see that he considered himself “in Christ.” “In  Christ” indicates a realm that is spiritual, heavenly, divine, and mystical. This realm is a divine and mystical realm. Those who are in Christ are in this divine and mystical realm, an all-inclusive and boundless realm in which Christ is all and in all.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 34.
