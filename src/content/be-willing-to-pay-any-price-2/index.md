> _"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.”"_
> 
> _Matthew 2:1-2 NASB_

Everything the wise men had pursued was touched by this star; this star was related to the meaning of life, related to the meaning of human existence, related to the meaning of the existence of all things on the earth, even related to the meaning of the universe. With this, the wise men had the understanding: “Let’s find Him. Let’s find Him, because now we realize a new age has come.” Thus the appearance of the star produced a new kind of pursuing—a long and treacherous path—to find Jesus. They said, “We would like to pay a price.”

Do you realize God’s desire is not for people to simply know something, to be happy, to say “We have a good time,” or even to say, “Oh, what a good message”—no. God desires people to say, “I see something, so I endeavor, I pursue, I pay a price, and I labor hard. I’d like to break the pattern of my daily life. I’d like to break the American culture of my life. I want to live unto God, to gain the best of Christ.”
