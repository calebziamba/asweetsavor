_But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know._ _– 1 John 2:20_

True teachers should never teach for the teaching itself. Our teaching must have the goal of leading people to Christ.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 151-152.
