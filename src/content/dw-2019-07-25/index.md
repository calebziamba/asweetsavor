_“For why should I be like one who veils herself_ _Beside the flocks of your companions?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

When we begin to love the Lord, we all have the feeling that we don’t know what it is to cooperate with others and to fellowship in the Body. Actually, our wandering alongside the flocks is the result of being too subjective. We have touched the Lord a little, and so we think we know how to follow the Lord. In reality, we still have a great lack, for we have only experienced the shining of the Lord; we have not yet experienced the working of the cross.
