_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

A good father must always be a good pattern to his children. If the father is a drunkard or a gambler, this is very hard on the children and hurts their growth. It is difficult to grow properly without a healthy pattern.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 160.
