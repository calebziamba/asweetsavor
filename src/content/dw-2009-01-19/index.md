_“The hand of the Lord has gone forth against me." —Ruth 1:13b_ Naomi recognized the Lord's hand in all that happened to her. She also exercised a genuine concern for others and exhibited a high humanity. We should have such a heart, always seeking the good of others. If a brother is weak, we should consider how we might strengthen him. If a sister is cold toward the Lord, we should struggle to find a way to help her love the Lord. If we simply judge others and place demands upon them, this indicates a lack in our humanity. We should learn of Naomi, for even in her distress she cared for the needs of others more than for her own needs. She was mature enough that she could consider others in such a way, entrusting herself and them to the Lord.
