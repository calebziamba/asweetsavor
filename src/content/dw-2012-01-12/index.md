_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the edge of his garments. — Psalm 133:1-2_

This fine oil that was poured upon Aaron’s head was the anointing oil, as described in Exodus 30:22-33. According to this psalm, what should characterize our unity? Our unity should be accompanied by the enjoyment of the divine anointing. For us to be under the divine anointing means that we are filled and saturated with the living presence of Christ.

Even though we may not have this consistently, we often have a foretaste of this in our meetings or in our fellowship with the saints. Sometimes we have the deep realization of the Lord’s presence because the divine anointing has come in and saturated us. Then we become more than joyful. We think, “Oh, how rich! Oh, how marvelous!” We may even enter into a kind of ecstasy, to the point where we forget who we are. Such a deep sensation shows that we are under the divine anointing.
