_Now when evening came David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king’s house, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance. So David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” – Second Samuel 11:1-3_

Bathsheba’s husband was Uriah, one of David’s mighty warriors (1 Chron. 11:26, 41). Because he was such a loyal soldier, he refused to spend time with his wife while his fellow soldiers were suffering on the field of battle, so David’s cover-up did not work. David then plotted to have Uriah killed by ordering Joab to send him to the battlefront and then withdraw the troops around him until he was exposed and killed. It is hard to believe David could do anything as terrible as this, but he did. Uriah was thus killed, and David took Bathsheba for his own wife. She bore him the son she had conceived with him.
