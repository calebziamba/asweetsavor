_That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit._ _– John 3:6_

We cannot truly worship God from afar. Rather, in true worship, we become one with God. We contact Him, we experience Him, and we enjoy Him. When we worship God in spirit, it means that we enjoy all the riches of Christ. It means that the Spirit of truth operates within our spirit to unveil Christ to us for our experience and enjoyment of all that He is and desires to be to us.
