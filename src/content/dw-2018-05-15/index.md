_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

Paul’s fourteen epistles, from Romans through Hebrews, are centered on Jesus Christ. For example, Galatians is about what Christ has accomplished. Ephesians is about the church as the body of Christ. Philippians is about pursuing Christ. Colossians is about the headship of Christ. First and Second Thessalonians are about the return of Christ. The last of Paul’s epistles, Hebrews, is about the excellence of Christ. Reading Romans through Hebrews reveals such a wonderful Christ! It seems Paul saw nothing but this wonderful Christ, and in seeing Him, he valued nothing higher.
