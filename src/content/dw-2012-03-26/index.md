_A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless the Lord, all servants of the Lord, Who serve by night in the house of the Lord! Lift up your hands to the sanctuary And bless the Lord! May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth. — Psalm 134:1-3_

Psalm 134 is the final psalm in our spiritual ascent up Mount Zion. It begins, “Bless the Lord now, all you servants of the Lord who stand by night in the house of the Lord” (v. 1).

After all of the previous experiences the psalmist is full of feeling, because he has come so far in his ascent. He can remember that once he was such a low person, in constant distress and full of deception. But now he has become different. By his growth in life he has entered into maturity, so he says, “Bless the Lord!”
