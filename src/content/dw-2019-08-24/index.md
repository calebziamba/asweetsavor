_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

According to v. 11, the plaits that God makes for us have studs of silver. Silver signifies redemption (cf. Exo. 30:13), and so the phrase “studs of silver” refers again to the work of the cross. If you wish to follow the Lord and live before Him, He will make you studs of silver. In other words, He will let the cross work on you.
