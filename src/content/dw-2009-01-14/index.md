_He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. And behold, water was trickling from the south side. When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles. Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the knees. — Ezekiel 47:2-4a_ Those who have experienced the flow only up to the ankles are free to do whatever they think is profitable. Those who go further and experience the flow up to the knees are those who include the Lord in their determinations. The decisions they make are according to whatever is profitable both to the Lord and to themselves. Now their declaration is, “I do what is profitable to the Lord, as long as it is profitable also to me.” They have had some experience of the Lord's measuring, but they have not yet experienced it to the extent that the Lord may bring them fully into His flow. If we are still free to pick and choose how the Lord would lead us, we need the Lord to come in and measure us further.
