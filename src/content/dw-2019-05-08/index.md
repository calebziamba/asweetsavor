_“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2, KJV_

When we really touch the Lord, we will suddenly feel that our life is full of Him. We don’t even have to say, “My Lord,” but only “Him,” because we feel it needs no explanation. When we have Him, our life is different. We are in love with the Lord and we possess His love, so it just seems that there is no need to explain.
