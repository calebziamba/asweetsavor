_Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord._ _– Genesis 13:18_

We should be able to tell the Lord, “I live in a tent. I am not rooted. I will go where You lead. I will do what You ask. I will walk the way which You choose. I can pack up my tent and start my journey anytime. I am here waiting for Your leading.” As Mary Gardiner Brainard wrote in her hymn:

_Where He may lead I’ll follow,_ _My trust in Him repose;_ _And every hour in perfect peace, I’ll sing,_ _“‘He knows, He knows”_
