_Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are....That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me._ _– John 17:11, 21_

As we love our fellow believers, we must endeavor to keep the oneness. We should not fight for practices or argue about doctrines, for neither of these is what really matters. What we do need is to be one. Among us there should be such a treasure, namely, that we love each other and that we are one. We shouldn’t care about anything except loving one another and keeping the oneness of the body of Christ.
