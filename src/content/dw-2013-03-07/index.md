_“Awake, O north wind,_ _And come, wind of the south;_ _Make my garden breathe out fragrance,_ _Let its spices be wafted abroad._ _May my beloved come into his garden_ _And eat its choice fruits!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:16_

At this point the seeker can testify of her story with the Lord over the years, how she helped the church at this time and blessed others at that time. She has many experiences to back her up.

When she looks back over her life, she can say, “Lord, I am not common anymore. I am special. I have all kinds of fragrances and choice fruit. The fragrances are for You to smell, and the fruit is for You to taste. All that I have and all that I have become are for Your satisfaction.”
