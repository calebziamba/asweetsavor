> letâ€™s keep living by that same _standard_ to which we have attained. Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.

There is so much Christ for us to experience and so many things we can do because of the freedom we have within that portion of Christ measured to us.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 232
