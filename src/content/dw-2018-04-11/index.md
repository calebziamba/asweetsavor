_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

Often, those who inherit everything do not know how to labor to produce anything themselves. They need to consider how to cut the way for the Lord’s testimony to continue on further, opening the door for others to labor also.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 134.
