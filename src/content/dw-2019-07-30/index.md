_“For why should I be like one who veils herself_ _Beside the flocks of your companions?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

In the church life, we should never try to keep someone by using him to do things. Although for a time this may seem effective, we should not think that we can use this way to perfect the saints. In particular, if we seek to establish someone in the church life by giving him some kind of responsibility before he has really touched the Lord, we are actually placing a stumbling block in front of him.

For example, if a high school student is asked to serve in children’s service, he will come to the Lord and pray seriously. Because he realizes he lacks experience, he will look to God to grant him the ability to serve properly. This service will probably strengthen his attachment to the church life, but as he grows and becomes more experienced, this service will no longer satisfy him. At that point he may disappear from the church life.
