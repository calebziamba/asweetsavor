_\[You are\] being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts._ _– 2 Corinthians 3:3_

One day everything the Lord has written upon us will be manifested. Unfortunately, some believers will have “letters” that are quite short, possibly just a few sentences long. At that time, these believers will realize that their Christian life was largely wasted, for almost nothing was written on their heart. They were genuinely saved, and therefore became letters of Christ, but the Lord was not able to write very much of Himself upon them.
