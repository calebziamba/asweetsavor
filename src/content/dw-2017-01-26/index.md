_In Him we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will._ _– Ephesians 1:11_

We, the believers, were designated as God’s inheritance. However, it is only when we experience the blessings we have received in our new birth that God’s inheritance in us can be fully realized. The apostle Paul prayed for the believers in Ephesians 1:18, asking

_that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._
