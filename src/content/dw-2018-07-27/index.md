_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Though we may look fallen, our gradual growth leads to our transformation. This transformation causes us to grow until we manifest something of glory. Our need was firstly outward—we were under God’s condemnation and needed the judicial redemption of Christ. When this need was met, our spiritual growth began to address our inward need of sanctification and transformation. This need is met by our experience of organic salvation. Finally, this inward growth is accompanied by an outward manifestation of glory.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 14.
