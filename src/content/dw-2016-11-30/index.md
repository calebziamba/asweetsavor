_Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Immediately they left their nets and followed Him._ _– Matthew 4:19–20_

In order to follow the Lord, we must heed His call. This was the way Abraham followed the Lord. God’s call to Abraham in Genesis 12 was not His first call. The first call is recorded in Acts 7 where Stephen testified, “The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you’” (Acts 7:2–3). When God appeared to Abraham, He called him.
