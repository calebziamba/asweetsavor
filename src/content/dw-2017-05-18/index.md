The teaching of merely “going to heaven” can damage a believer’s conscience and cause him to have no spiritual feeling or sensation. If we are born again but merely waiting to go to heaven, living however we choose, it will be difficult for others to realize that we are born again. In fact, it may even be difficult for us to realize that we are born again.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 70.
