> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:20 Darby

Regardless how different we are from one another—such as in culture, age, or political view—in this heavenly commonwealth, we all share an association in the divine life.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 244
