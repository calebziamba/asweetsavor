_King Solomon made for himself a palanquin_ _From the timber of Lebanon._ _He made its posts of silver,_ _Its bottom of gold_ _And its seat of purple fabric,_ _With its interior lovingly fitted out_ _By the daughters of Jerusalem._ _— Song of Songs 3:9-10_

Originally in the Song of Songs, the seeker cared very much for herself, but now she receives the work of the cross in order to deal with her flesh. Originally she sought the Lord’s comfort when she was sad, and if the Lord didn’t show her any sympathy, she shed more tears. Now her weeping is mingled with praises for the work of the Lord on His cross. She says "Amen" to the Lord’s dealing, because she is made of silver. In this regard, her feelings match those of the Lord.
