_“Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock, Where do you make it lie down at noon?” – Song of Songs 1:7"_

Here she has a prayer, “Lord, please tell me, where do You pasture Your flock? Others have asked me to serve in some matters, but I feel uneasy about it. I want to labor according to my burden, but the brothers don’t agree. Oh, Lord, where do You pasture Your flock?”

Our vineyard represents what the Lord has committed to us; it is a place where we work. The seeker feels that she has her commission from the Lord, and she also focuses upon her relationship with the Lord. Outwardly, she may seem to be very busy in tending the vineyard and caring for others, but if the work is not from God or if it is not carried out in an intimate relationship with the Lord, it will be in vain. A true lover of the Lord will ask, “Tell me, You whom my soul loves, where do You pasture Your flock?” so that he may know how to work with the Lord. How we all need to have such a prayer, rather than just pay attention to our work!
