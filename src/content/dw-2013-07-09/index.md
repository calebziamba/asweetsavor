_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

 _Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed. Therefore let us celebrate the feast.... — First Corinthians 5:7-8_

When the Israelites left Egypt to hold a feast to their God, they experienced a reconstituting work by enjoying all the riches and provisions from Jehovah. This heavenly diet of manna made them a living testimony unto Jehovah and an expression of all His riches. As New Testament saints, we participate in Christ as our feast (1 Cor. 5:7). With this feast, we experience joyfulness and celebration. Thus, through our subjective experience of Him, we become the living testimony of the Lord today and the expression of His unsearchable riches.
