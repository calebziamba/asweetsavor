_I recall your tears._  
_– 2 Timothy 1:4_

If we are so touched by a verse from the Bible that we are brought to tears, it shows we are participating in that passage. Tears can also indicate that we are active participants in the lives of others.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 156.
