If you want to be a Joshua, be prepared, be trained, and be educated by God. Tell the Lord, “Everything Joshua learned I would also like to learn. I would like to learn not to trust anything from the world. I would like to only care for Christ and the enjoyment in Christ. I want to fight for Your testimony and for the healthy church life. With all the riches of Christ I gain, I also want to learn to be a tent keeper.”
