_So David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy the king your lord. — First Samuel 26:15_

David rebuked Abner instead of Saul (1 Sam 26:15–16). He could have laughed at Saul and told him to give up, for the Lord was not with him. By removing Saul’s spear and jug of water, David touched Saul’s supply and protection.

David could have said, “Look, Saul. You can neither fight nor even live. Everything is in my hand. Now go home!” Instead he rebuked Abner for not protecting his master, the anointed king.
