_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Paul called the Philippians “my beloved,” and also recognized they had always obeyed him. Their obedience to the Lord was also their obedience to the apostle.

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ,”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 114.
