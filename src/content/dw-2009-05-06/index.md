If you desire to be one with the ministry, you must learn to have the spirit of the ministry. Eventually, you must become a spiritual man, and a man of God.

A spiritual man and a man of God are not the same thing. It is possible for a spiritual person to be not of God, and it is possible for a man of God to behave in an unspiritual manner.

Spirituality refers to substance while “of God” refers to position. Someone may be spiritual in substance, and yet not be a man of God. He may be substantially full of the Spirit, and yet still exercise according to his own plans and wishes. Such a person is not of God. On the other hand, someone might be of God, having committed everything to God, and may not be spiritual at all. Therefore we must learn to be both spiritual and of God.
