_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure._ _—Philippians 2:12–13_

_How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard?_ _— Hebrews 2:3_

What a wonderful salvation! We should be in fear that we might neglect it (Heb. 2:3), for it is God Himself who is working in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. What a mercy that we can participate in such a complete salvation! How awful if we neglect it, and how awesome to gain it!
