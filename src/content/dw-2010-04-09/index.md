The principle in Christianity is to be logical and effective, whereas in the Lord’s recovery our guiding principle is that everything must be spiritual. When we serve the Lord, it must be a matter of the Spirit, not a matter of simply studying what is most effective.

Others may promote some among them who have Ph.D.’s and advertise that they have “Dr. So-and-So” as a preacher. To do so may seem logical. Wouldn’t that seem to benefit us and gain us some respect and credibility? It may indeed, but it may not be something of the Spirit.
