_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’”_ _–  Acts 7:2-3_

We are able to follow the Lord based on His choosing. He initiates, and we have His appearing, His call, His promise, and His power and unchanging nature. God bore responsibility for Abraham to the end through His power and unchanging nature.
