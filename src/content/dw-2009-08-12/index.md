_I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. — Song of Songs 1:5_

When the Lord shines upon you, you realize that you are as black inwardly and outwardly as the tents of Kedar. However, the more you see your blackness, the more you also see your inward beauty in the Lord, and you realize, “I am black, but lovely.”

Your inner loveliness corresponds to how much you realize your blackness. The more you realize you are black, the more lovely you will be. What you consider to be weakness, failure, and ugliness is actually considered as loveliness by God. When you are exposed, you feel weak and vulnerable, but in such a weak and vulnerable state you become lovely, and you are appreciated by God.
