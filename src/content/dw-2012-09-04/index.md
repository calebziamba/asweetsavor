_King Solomon made for himself a palanquin_ _From the timber of Lebanon._ _He made its posts of silver,_ _Its bottom of gold_ _And its seat of purple fabric,_ _With its interior lovingly fitted out_ _By the daughters of Jerusalem._ _— Song of Songs 3:9-10_

The wood of Lebanon is cedar wood, which denotes Christ’s noble humanity. The Lord’s lover being made a palanquin of cedar indicates that she has been constituted with Christ’s noble humanity.

The posts of the palanquin are made of silver, which means that the supporting element in the seeker for this move is the redemption of Christ. Due to Christ’s redemption the seeker’s speaking is different, her behavior is different, her thought is different, and her living is different.
