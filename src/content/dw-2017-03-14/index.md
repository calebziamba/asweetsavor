_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure._ _—Philippians 2:12–13_

One Christian brother has testified, “I received my doctorate from a prestigious university. So did my colleague. I became a professor in a university, and so did he. I published papers, and so did he. One day I came to myself and asked the question, ‘What is the difference between me, one who loves the Lord, and this other person who does not?’ Then I realized only a foolish person would be such a professor. A wise person would serve the Lord!” He thus felt led to drop his professorship and serve the Lord full time. This is an example of God working in someone both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.
