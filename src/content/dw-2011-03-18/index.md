_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste. He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:3-4_

Brothers and sisters, a person who realizes that he is overshadowed by the Lord’s banner of love is restful. He has tears before the Lord but they are the tears of joy. He can go on together with the Lord without any hesitation or fear.
