_David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down to him. And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. — 1 Samuel 22:1-2_

Normally, a child’s growth requires healthy parenting. There are children who grow well even though their parents do not care for them, but these are exceptions. Healthy parental care requires a willingness to sacrifice on behalf of children who may not appreciate what their parents suffer. What is needed in today’s church life is this kind of sacrificial care (2 Cor. 12:15).
