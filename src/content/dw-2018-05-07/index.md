_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _â€” Romans 1:1-3_

How can we describe the gospel? Many Christians would describe it as the means by which people are saved. However, the gospel is not merely the means of salvation; in reality, the gospel is the Son of God Himself, Jesus Christ our Lord.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, pages 4-5.
