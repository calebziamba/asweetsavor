You may have heard that the prodigal son in Luke chapter 15 represents a Christian who departs from God and lives a worldly life, getting involved in immoral things. However, Titus Chu's interpretation is different. In this 5 minute video he portrays another side to the well-known story of the prodigal son, drawing on his own past experience as a young Christian.
