_No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His body._ _– Ephesians 5:29–30_

After being born again, we may have the concept that we can still live in an individualistic way, but the verses above show us that we have been born again to be members of Christ’s body.
