_Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.” Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the Lord is with you.” – Second Samuel 7:1-3_

Once David had settled into his house and the Lord had given Israel rest from their enemies, David said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells inside tent curtains” (2 Sam. 7:2).

In saying this, David implied his desire to build God a house. God had never given David a hint that He desired such a thing. It came out of David’s heart. As he was dwelling in his house of cedar, he felt it was not fitting that God would dwell in tent curtains—He should have the best. I hope all believers could have this feeling that God deserves the best.
