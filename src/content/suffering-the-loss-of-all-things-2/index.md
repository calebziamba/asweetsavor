> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8

Suppose, after investing ourselves in a career and attaining a respectable position, the Lord would lead us to move. Would we be able to count our position as loss? How hard that struggle would be! Would we be able to give up our house and uproot our family? Yet the reward is so wonderfulâ€”gaining Christ and being found in Him.
