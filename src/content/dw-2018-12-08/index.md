_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

Parents don’t give up on their children just because of weaknesses. For instance, many children love to chew bubble gum. Parents may realize the downsides of bubble gum—it decays teeth, sticks to furniture, and gets in hair. However in the eyes of these parents, gum is only a minor weakness in comparison to their plan for their children’s future. Children are the center and focus of the family. Parents are always considering how to raise their children and how to make them flourish. The weaknesses of the children become irrelevant in the grand scheme of their parents’ plan for them.
