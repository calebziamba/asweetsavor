_The Lord is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are contrite in spirit. — Psalm 34:18_

David wrote the words above while he was in the cave of Adullam. When he was riding before a great army, praised and viewed as such a manifest champion of the Lord, he didn’t know what it was to have a broken heart. By the time he reached the cave of Adullam, however, his suffering brought him this experience. Yet he could still praise the Lord and testify that the Lord was good.

The two do not conflict. You can experience being brokenhearted and tasting the Lord’s sweetness at the same time. Your spirit can be joyful, even as your soul suffers.
