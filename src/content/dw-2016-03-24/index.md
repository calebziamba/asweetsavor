_God did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly._ _– Second Peter 2:5_

When we read the account of Noah in Genesis, it seems that the ark was built very quickly. In fact, it took many years. We cannot imagine how Noah suffered people’s scoffing for those many years. He didn’t build the ark silently but warned the people of that age as a preacher of righteousness (2 Pet. 2:5).
