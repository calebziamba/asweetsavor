_“Take Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister to Me as priest, Aaron and Aaron’s sons: Nadab, Abihu, Elemazar, and Ithamar.” — Exodus 28:1_

God also initiated the service of the priesthood at this time. Besides the tabernacle, Moses was to prepare the priesthood. With us also, the Lord desires both a testimony and a priesthood to maintain that testimony. These are beyond simply enjoying Christ in the church life. Our vision must advance, and our experience must advance with it.
