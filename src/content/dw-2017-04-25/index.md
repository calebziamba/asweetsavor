_The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran._ _– Genesis 11:32_

Only God’s discipline can take away our natural reliance. He not only appears to us and supplies us but also disciplines us. Many adversities make us suffer, but because of them our reliance upon our natural strength is taken from us. God takes away the things that our flesh depends on for strength.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; pages 93-94.
