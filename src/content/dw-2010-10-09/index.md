_Our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed. So then let us akeep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. — First Corinthians 5:7b-8_ The second thing the Lord said in His reaction to Moses’ taking Jethro’s advice was, “Three times you shall keep a feast to Me in the year” (Exo. 23:14). God’s solution to disagreements among His people was very different from Jethro’s. His solution was to feast together.

Today’s churches are still in danger of trying to solve problems among believers by turning to natural sources. God’s way, however, is that we enjoy Him in a feasting life (1 Cor. 5:7–8). In such a church life, nothing is brought in but what is of God. There are no opinions or gossip. Instead, there is just feasting! The entire church life must be saturated with nothing besides God. The issue then is something wonderful.
