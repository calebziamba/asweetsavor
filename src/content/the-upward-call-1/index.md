> But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:13b-14 ESV

The Greek word for “goal” here is _skopos_, which “has the two senses of ‘overseer’ and ‘mark’ at which one shoots” (Kittel, p. 1047). The mark at which we aim is Christ, and the One who is overseeing our pursuit toward that goal is also Christ.
