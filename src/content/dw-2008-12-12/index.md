_The Lord is your keeper; The Lord is your shade on your right hand. The sun will not smite you by day, Nor the moon by night. The Lord will keep you from all evil; He will keep your soul. The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in From this time forth and forever. — Psalm 121:5-8_

We surely have a marvelous Lord, who keeps us in every way for His economy. We can have such a strong and solid trust in Him. We trust in Him not only as our Creator but as the One who keeps us for His testimony. This is the second vision, the vision concerning the Lord.

Now we begin to see a clear picture. As those who are ascending Mount Zion in our spiritual experience we must first see such a vision as described in Psalm 120 and Psalm 121. We should all be able to say, “I see the world. It is full of lies and deceit. It is full of vain and empty prosperity, and full of religious hypocrisy. I have nothing to do with this. But I also know my Lord. He will not let my foot slip back into the world. He is not only my Keeper but the Keeper of Israel. He keeps me not only for my sake but for the sake of His testimony. Because of this, all my trust is in Him.” May we all see such a vision. Praise the Lord!
