_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

Much of our grumbling and disputing is directed at the various situations we encounter. When we begin to complain and dispute, eventually contentions arise among us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; page 122.
