> _“Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are differences of operation, but it is the same God who operates all things in all.”_
> 
> _(1 Corinthians 12:4-6)_

The Lord has no intention. The Lord says there are differences of gifts but the same spirit. There are differences of ministry but the same Lord. There are differences of operations but the same God who operates all things in all. You see? Then I tell you, \[you\] may never be famous. You may never be glorious in a sense, holding a conference and all the young people look at them “I wish I just could be like that someday. I wish I could be like that someday, so wonderful.” You know, nobody appreciates you. You're old. You’re uneducated. You are even a high school dropout. But, when people touch you, they begin to pray. When you see people, you begin to pray. Your prayer ministry becomes a real blessing to the churches.
