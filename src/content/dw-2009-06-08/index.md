_So everything will live where the river goes. â€” Ezekiel 47:9b_ Once you experience being made alive in the divine flow, that life will bring in light. You will be enlightened. The flow of life will also bring you into the experience of tabernacling with the Lord. In this mutual abode you experience grace and reality.

During the nearly 50 years of my life with the Lord, I have increasingly experienced this. Many mornings I rise up very tired. On such days, I still can experience His grace. It is very sweet. The experience of grace is something sweet and restful. You cannot quite put it into words, but it satisfies. You may not necessarily feel that you need to proclaim it to the universe, but grace is there, upholding, supplying, and satisfying you.
