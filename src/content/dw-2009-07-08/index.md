_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! — John 1:29_

Even when we tell the Lord, “I love You,” we experience Him as the Lamb. The more we say, “Lord Jesus, I love You,” and the more we take Him as a person, the more Christ as the Lamb becomes subjective to us. We realize, “Because of the Lamb, I'm so clean, so sanctified, so purified. I have no more sins. I have no more problems.”

We don't need to pray, “Oh, Lord Jesus, take away this sin,” or, “Lord Jesus, help me overcome my sin.” We don't need to pray this way; we just need to enjoy Christ as the Lamb of God. We were born again to enjoy the living person of Christ. We were born again to enjoy Christ as our Lamb, the very Lamb of God. The more we enjoy this Christ, that is, the more we experience the Lamb, the more our sins are taken care of.

We should have this experience all the time. When we are so much in the enjoyment of the Lord's presence, we completely forget about our sins. We even forget that we are a sinner. If someone tries to convince us, “You're a sinner,” we'll say, “I don't know what you mean. I don't remember that.” They might say, “Didn't you behave improperly this morning?” We'll say, “Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot all about that!” “How could you forget about that?” “I don't know. I'm just with a person. I don't think about my sins and shortcomings. I'm with Christ, the Lamb of God. This person is so holy. When I experience Him, when I enjoy Him, He takes away all the things related to sin.” We should all experience such an enjoyment of Christ as the Lamb.
