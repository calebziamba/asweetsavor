_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

All who are called by the Lord and follow Him experience the same basic steps of His calling. The Lord initiates, He appears and we see His loveliness, He calls us, we receive His promise, and we have the assurance that He remains as the holding power of our faith and will never change. This was Abraham’s experience when God appeared to him.
