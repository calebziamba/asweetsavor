_“You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse;_ _You have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes,_ _With one strand of your necklace.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:9_

Here the Shulammite answers the Lord’s calling first with one glance of her eyes, and then with one strand of her necklace.

She doesn’t argue with the Lord or bargain with Him anymore. She answers with her eyes, ravishing His heart with her glance. The best way to know whether someone is one with you is by the glance of their eyes. This is often true between a husband and wife.
