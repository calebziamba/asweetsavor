_But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition. For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare. For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus. But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father._ _—Philippians 2:19–22_

According to Paul, the Philippians knew of Timothy’s proven worth (Phil. 2:22). This implies that they approved of Timothy. Paul also approved of him, highly recommending him to the Philippians.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 137.
