_Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life. â€” John 8:12_ We also need to enjoy Christ as the light of life (John 8:12). When we enjoy Christ this way, we know how to walk rightly. We are no longer in darkness. We realize what is right and what is wrong. Christ as the light of life shines within us for our daily walk.
