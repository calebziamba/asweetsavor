_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

_Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14_

In principle, every spiritual experience you have can become a wall preventing you from going on further. The more you grow in the Lord, the fewer walls you will have, for you gradually learn that there is always something more that the Lord wants to bring you into. If you want to hold onto something you gained from these very messages, for example, it will become a wall preventing the Lord from taking you on further.
