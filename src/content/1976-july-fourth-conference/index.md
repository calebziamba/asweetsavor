Brother Titus speaks on Ephesians from the perspective of God's economy.

## Meeting One

God has a purpose. What is the place of man in that purpose? Man is the "bursting out" of God.

## Meeting Two

Unavailable

## Meeting Three

\[Incomplete\] What does it mean that believers are "seated in the heavenlies with Christ"? What is the "one new man"? What is the essence of fellowship?

## Meeting Four

A practical talk on the proper ground of the church, functioning of members, and communal living.
