_It came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. â€“ Genesis 15:17 (ASV)_

When we are buoyant, we should get ready for the smoking furnace. When things are difficult, we should not lose heart but know that the flaming torch is coming. If we never experience this cycle of the smoking furnace and the flaming torch, we should seek the Lord, for something is wrong.
