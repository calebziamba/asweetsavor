_“Rightly do they love you.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:4_

God desires to gain a group of people as virgins who love Him rightly. Such virgins do not have any plans for themselves. If there are many virgins in a church loving the Lord rightly, He will have a church as a whole that is loving Him rightly, and it will be easy for that church to be built up. The question is, how many of us rightly love Him? How many of us love Him without any requests, reservations, or conditions? How many of us have such a pure love toward the Lord?
