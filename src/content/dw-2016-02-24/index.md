_He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him._ _– John 3:36_

Even when we were young, we had a tendency towards disobedience. We were disobedient to our parents and disobedient to our teachers. Then when we grew up, we were disobedient to God Himself. Before we believed in the Lord, we often reacted when someone talked about Jesus. We could talk about philosophy and religion in a general way, but if someone said, “You need to believe in Jesus,” we would say, “I’m not interested!”

Because we were disobedient to the Son, refusing to believe in Him and be saved, we were under God’s wrath.
