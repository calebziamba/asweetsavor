_And He is the Head of the Body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything He might be preeminent.For in Him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell. — Colossians 1:18-19_ In the new creation, Christ is the One in whom all the fullness is pleased to dwell (1:19). There is no “fullness” in the old creation, for only in the new creation is Christ’s person expressed. In the old creation one can see Christ’s power and wisdom, but in the new creation the fullness of Christ’s person is manifested. In other words, in the new creation all of the divine attributes of Christ will be exhibited.

As an example, since coming to this country, my weight has nearly doubled. What has happened? Don’t blame me; blame the rich food I have enjoyed. I have participated in all of the many riches here, so I have become something of the fullness of this country. However, Christ can say that He enjoys and embodies all the riches of the Triune God. He is the full expression of all that God is. In Christ the fullness finally has found a place to dwell. In Christ, God is pleased to be fully expressed.
