_No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His body._ _– Ephesians 5:29–30_

We should not think, “As long as I take good care of myself spiritually and pray from time to time, that’s enough. I can live the Christian life on my own.” That is a fallen concept. The Lord would respond, “No, that is not My way. That is not why I saved you. You were born again to be a member of My body. You were saved as an individual, but you have received a corporate life, and I have placed you in a corporate position. You cannot live as an individual any longer.”

By being born again we have become the members of Christ. Our new position does not allow us to be individualistic anymore.
