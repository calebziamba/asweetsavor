## Chapter Summary

### Chapter Four: Thyatira

The fourth church in the series is Thyatira, and Nee sees it represented in the Roman Catholic Church. Thyatira means “the sacrifice of perfumes” and represents the emphasis that the church puts on outward behavior and sacrifices of its members. What matters is what the church says, not what the Bible or the Lord says.

But, amid the immorality and the leading astray of the Lord’s bondservants, the Lord recognizes love, faith, service and perseverance, and calls the saints out to be overcomers. He will give them the morning star! Though Thyatira is fallen, the Lord still acknowledges the value in the Roman Catholic Church, for out of it came Madame Guyon, Tauler, Fenelon, and many more faithful believers.

> _The one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received authority from my Father. And I will give him the morning star._
> 
> \- Rev 2:26-28 ESV

## A Reader's Testimony: The Morning Star

> _"At the darkest hour, just at the time the day is breaking, it appears for a little while, and then the sun arises. Many people see the sun, but few have seen the morning star."_
> 
> \- _The Orthodoxy of the Church_, Watchman Nee

In regards to the church in Thyatira God gives two promises: “And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father. And to him I will give the morning star.” (Rev 2:26-28)

I’m particularly inspired by the second promise about the morning star.  The morning star is so very special! It’s special for two reasons: one, because it appears while it’s still dark, and two, because only a few will see it before the sun rises because they have risen before others are still sleeping. In Revelation 22:16, Jesus refers to Himself as the morning star. It really struck me that all will eventually see the Lord in His glory when He returns, similar to how everyone will see the sun. Yet before that time, there are those that rise early to see Jesus and His glory in secret, while it’s still dark, before He returns. Since reading this I have a deeper desire to spend quiet and intimate time with the Lord, longing to possess Him in the midst of darkness. The Lord and His glory will appear, but I’d like Him to appear as my morning star many times in my life before He is revealed for all to see.
