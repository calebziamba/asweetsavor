_Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death._ _– Genesis 24:67_

Rebekah went with the servant to meet Isaac in the land of Canaan. Isaac was waiting for his bride. While he was meditating in a field, Rebekah and the servant arrived. When Rebekah saw Isaac, she sprang off the camel and covered herself with her veil. Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and loved her. So Isaac was comforted.

Isaac brought Rebekah to the tent of Sarah, his mother. Sarah signifies the promise of God (Gal. 4:22–23), the grace of God. When we (Rebekah) meet the Lord (Isaac) at the end of this age of grace, it will be the end of our journey.
