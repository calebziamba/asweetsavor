_"O my dove, In the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_

If we compare our experience of Christ here to what is described in chapter one of the Song of Songs, we will see that the experience of chapter one is very shallow in comparison. Here the Lord calls us into union with Him, a union that is far beyond the seeker’s past union with the Lord through merely being in love with Him.

In this union in the clefts of the rock, all of Christ’s experiences become our experiences. We go through what the Lord went through. We weep as He wept. We are struck and misunderstood as He was. The Lord desires to see us in the clefts of the rock, that is, He desires that through the union of the cross we would experience what He experienced.
