_"So Jacob named the place Peniel, for he said, "I have seen  
God face to face, yet my life has been preserved.""  
\- Genesis 32:30  
_

As Jacob looked back on all his past experiences, he must have realized that all the situations he passed through were used by God to work on him. We need the Lord’s mercy so that we may clearly see God’s plan, His work on us, and the value He has placed on us. Once we see this, we can no longer act or walk as we wish. We will walk in His restriction.
