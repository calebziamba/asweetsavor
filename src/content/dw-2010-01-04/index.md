_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine.” — Song of Songs 1:1-2_

Our Lord cannot reveal Himself to us all at once, or we would not be able to stand before Him. He is too perfect. He is holy and righteous. Eventually as we come to know Him further, we will experience His judging. But if we were to experience all His judging from the time we began to pursue Him, we would die not only spiritually but even physically.

If the Lord were to reveal all His glory to us, no one could survive. When the Lord appeared to Isaiah, he said, “Woe is me, for I am undone!” (Isa. 6:5). The Lord cannot fully reveal Himself to someone who just begins to love Him. So He at first appears in love to sustain His seeker. Thus, at the beginning of our Christian life, our first experience is of His love. In His love He attracts us. In this way He encourages our hearts to pursue Him. When we pray to Him just a little, “Let Him kiss me,” He comes immediately.
