_“For your love is better than wine.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2_

At the start of our Christian experience, we are not yet touching the Lord Himself; we are only touching His love. This shows us a basic principle: if we want to enjoy the Lord Himself, we need to pay a price to spend time before Him.  
  
How much we see of Him depends on our capacity. The vision and experiences we can receive depend on our measure of life. The more we grow, the more He will show us who He is and how boundless He is. We need to have a yearning for more growth in life. Eventually, the Lord will bring us into the experience not only of His love but of Himself directly.
