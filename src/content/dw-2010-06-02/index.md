_Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. — Exodus 19:5-6

But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. — First Peter 2:9_

The Lord’s treasured people also become to Him a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). In the Old Testament, God gained a group of priests who functioned together as a priesthood. In the New Testament, God has gained us so that we may serve Him together in the church life as His priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6).
