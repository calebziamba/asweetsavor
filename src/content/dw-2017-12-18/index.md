_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

All the world “lies in the power of the evil one” (1 John 5:19). All the power in the world is Satan’s to give to whomever he wishes (Luke 4:5–7). Everyone around us is making Satan their god, for he promises to provide for them (Jabal), to make them happy (Jubal), and to grant them protection and victory (Tubal-cain). These are the very things the Lord desires to be responsible for in our lives. Therefore, do not love the world, nor the things in the world (1 John 2:15).
