_“Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock, Where do you make it lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?”_

_“If you yourself do not know, Most beautiful among women, Go forth in the footsteps of the flock And pasture your young goats By the shepherds’ tents.” — Song of Songs 1:7-8_

When we begin following the Lord, somehow we mix other things in with our loving the Lord, and we easily go astray. Even our pursuing can become mixed up with some kind of work.

Therefore we must go forth in the footsteps of the flock, which is the way of life. In our following of the Lord we will not end up in a situation that no one has ever experienced before. Often we can experience a breakthrough by receiving the riches from those who have passed on in this way before us.
