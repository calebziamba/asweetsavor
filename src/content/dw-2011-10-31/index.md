_And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, “Are You for us or for our adversaries?” So He said, “No, but as Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.” — Joshua 5:13-14_

This Man was the messenger God said He would send ahead of them (Exo. 33:2). He was the Lord Jesus Christ. We do not follow any particular side among men; we follow Jesus Christ! Those who follow a man will change from one camp to another depending upon whichever side is profitable to them. The Lord told Joshua He was not on either side. He was there to take charge.

Christians like to tell the Lord that He must be on their side even when those on the other side are their fellow believers. However, the Lord is not on this side or that side. He requires that we all be on His side.
