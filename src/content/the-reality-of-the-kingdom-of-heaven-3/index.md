This declaration, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand,” indicated that the day for God and man to be united and mingled was at hand. It meant that salvation is at hand. When salvation comes, you are united with God; you are mingled with God. Now the Lord Jesus can come into your spirit and rule over you. Now He was a prototype. Now we have the reality: I'm saved, the Lord is in me, so the kingdom of heaven is right here with me.
