_“Surely I will not enter the tabernacle of my house, Nor lie on my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:3-5_

_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the edge of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon — Psalm 133:1-2_

We need to remember that oneness is not merely an emotional experience. We tend to enjoy this psalm in an emotional way, but then we live our own life apart from the Lord’s headship. This can never work to bring in the Lord’s blessing.

If we want such a reality of oneness, then we need the experiences from Psalm 132. Our house should be God’s tabernacle. Eventually we lose “our house” and only His tabernacle remains. This means that we lose everything of ourselves. But when we experience the ark of testimony as the reality of God’s habitation, then in such a condition we can testify, “Behold! Oh, behold! How pleasant it is! Look at all the dear saints! They are all just for Christ! They are under His headship! They don’t express themselves! They only express the person of Christ!”

It is when the saints are in such a condition that we can truly testify, “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity!” When we are all living Christ, taking Him as our person and as our Head, then the church life becomes glorious. We enjoy oneness with the divine anointing.
