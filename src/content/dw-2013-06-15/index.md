One who has a personality that is useful to the Lord normally experiences transformation from the beginning of his Christian life. He begins very much in the Lord’s presence, touching the Lord, experiencing the Lord, and enjoying the Lord.

We can see this characteristic in those who have had a strong initial encounter with the Lord. This is the beginning of the Lord’s constituting work in the personality in those who have met Him.
