_We have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves._ _– Second Corinthians 4:7_

As human beings, we are earthen vessels, but when we were born again we received a heavenly treasure into our earthen vessels. We became vessels unto honor, because we received the very life of God Himself. As vessels we are still earthen, but now we contain something that is truly heavenly. We do not need to dream about “going to heaven” one day, because we already have something heavenly within us. This content, the life of God, makes us vessels unto honor.
