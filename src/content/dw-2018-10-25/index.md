Every truth we see becomes our test. While in Joppa, Peter saw a vision concerning the oneness of the Jewish and Gentile believers. He acted on this vision at the house of Cornelius but later failed the same test at Antioch when he separated himself from the Gentile believers (Acts 10; Gal. 2:11–13).

Once we see the oneness of the body, we will be tested. Once we see that we are crucified with Christ, we will again be tested. Every truth we think we know will become a test in our experience. The Lord is in control at all times and in all situations.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 147.
