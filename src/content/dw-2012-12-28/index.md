_But when David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How the king of Israel distinguished himself today! He uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants’ maids as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!”_

_So David said to Michal, “It was before the Lord, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel; therefore I will celebrate before the Lord._ _— Second Samuel 6:20-21_

How David must have felt! Here he was, king over the most wonderful people on the earth, with God as his King. Therefore, he danced before the Lord, leaping and whirling. What’s more, he said, “I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight” (v. 22).

David had such a deep realization that everything in his life had been according to God’s mercy. Because of this, he did not despise himself but rather respected what God had done in him.

Michal, on the other hand, despised David’s joy in the Lord and therefore “had no children to the day of her death” (v. 23).
