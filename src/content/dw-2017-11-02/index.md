_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

To do all things without grumbling or disputing seems impossible, especially for those given to serving their church. Since they are so faithful, they will be pressed, for there is so much to do. It then becomes very easy to grumble and dispute, and with good reason.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; page 121.
