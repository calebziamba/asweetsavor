_Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. â€” Matthew 5:8_

What marks purity? The pure person simply cares for Christ. This is the condition of a newly saved person. He loves Jesus, and he realizes that Jesus loves him and has died for him. Such a person belongs to Christ alone. The Bible tells us that the pure in heart shall see God (Matt. 5:8). Those who are pure are able to see God in everything. They only see Christ.
