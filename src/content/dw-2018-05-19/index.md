_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

The longer we love and follow the Lord, the harder it becomes for us to solely desire Him. New believers are very simple: they only love the Lord, want Him, and desire to follow Him. At the time they believe, they truly gain Christ, live Him out, and enjoy Him. Christ is everything to them, and their prayers are often filled with simple expressions like, “Lord Jesus, I love You! Lord Jesus, I want to gain You, enjoy You, and come close to You! Lord Jesus, I want a healthy relationship with You, and You are all I want in my life! Beside You, I want nothing!”

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 7.
