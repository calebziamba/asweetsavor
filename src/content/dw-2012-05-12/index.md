_"On my bed night after night I sought him Whom my soul loves; I sought him but did not find him. I must arise now and go about the city." — Song of Songs 3:1-2_

At this point the Shulammite hadn’t discovered that her being deprived of the Lord’s presence was not caused by some item in her spiritual life. She did not see that she herself was the problem.

Although she went about in the city, in the streets, or in the squares seeking her beloved, she did not find Him. Although she tried to imitate others’ calling upon the name of the Lord, pray-reading, singing, and praying, she was unable to recover her sweet fellowship with the Lord. She could not recover His presence.

In fact, the Lord didn’t lead her to read more, pray more, call upon Him more, or to be more zealous. His call was for her to rise up and pay the price of following in the way of the cross. He desired that she experience the bitterness of death and the glory of resurrection. His intention was to deliver her from herself and to help her enter into His rich and fresh supply.
