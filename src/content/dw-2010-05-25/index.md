_“As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” — Joshua 24:15b_

By the end of his life, Joshua ruled Israel for God. At that point, he was a picture of Christ as Head over His church. His preparation for ruling Israel was in three stages: commitment, learning, and manifestation. These stages show us what it means to follow the Lord and serve Him.
