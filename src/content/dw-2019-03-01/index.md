_Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.  
__– 2 Timothy 2:20_

Our companions are another factor for our approvedness. Paul wrote to Timothy that in a large house there are vessels both to honor and to dishonor (2 Tim. 2:20). The church is a large house, and its members are the many vessels. Paul went on to charge Timothy to “flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart” (v. 22).
