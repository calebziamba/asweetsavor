Before we were saved, not only were we under God’s judgment, but we were also condemned. To be condemned is both to be found guilty and to be completely disapproved. God’s judgment on us resulted in our condemnation. John 3:18 (NKJV) says,

_He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God._

Because we did not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God, we were under God’s condemnation.
