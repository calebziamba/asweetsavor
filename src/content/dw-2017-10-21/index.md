_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

Why didn’t Abraham argue with God? Why didn’t he bargain with Him like he did for Lot (Gen. 18:23–33)? Why didn’t he beg God? Why was he so simple, offering Isaac just like that? It was because he knew God. God’s working on him and leading him made him realize that only God Himself is the portion of the called ones. Eventually he had nothing left but the God who called him.
