_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

When Paul mentions the brothers and sisters in chapter 16, his sweetness, satisfaction, love, intimacy, hope, concern, and expectation are all revealed to us. We cannot help but worship the Lord, saying, “Lord, thank You. Here was a man who was not only renewed but was also transformed and fully connected with the saints in life.” Paul’s healthy connection with the saints shows the highest level of the experience of transformation and is the mature conclusion to the whole book of Romans.
