_This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you. â€” John 15:12_ We were born again into the Body of Christ. We should no longer be by ourselves. We should no longer care just for ourselves. We should care for the new ones and care for the young ones. We should love one another, keep the oneness, and feed and shepherd the lambs and the sheep. These are the three commissions in the Gospel of John.
