_Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold. He went on his journeys from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai._ _– Genesis 13:2-3_

_“Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me; if to the left, then I will go to the right; or if to the right, then I will go to the left.”_ _– Genesis 13:9_

On the one hand, Abraham’s journey to Egypt was a failure and seemed to be a waste. On the other hand, he came back different. God used his failure for his growth.
