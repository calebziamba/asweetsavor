_“For your love is better than wine.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2_

The Song of Songs begins with the seeker’s request—“Let him” (1:2) —and continues with her testimony—“for your.”  
  
Concerning the Lord we love, we can testify, “I have but one world. Whether in my testimony or in my prayer, I am focused on the Lord. Besides Him I have nothing in my life, for His love is better than wine.”

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 20.
