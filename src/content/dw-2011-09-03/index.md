I was allowed into an officers’ language school to learn English even though I was only a high school graduate. For one year, I worked as an interpreter for American officers before I entered college. The Lord used this to prepare me to serve Him in the United States. I had no plan to come to the United States, yet He put me into a military language school to learn English whether I wanted to or not. I became, in fact, the English interpreter for my own father—just consider how enjoyable that was!

Therefore, when a time of testing comes, do not be discouraged, for there is nothing to be discouraged about. The Lord is at work. We all must appreciate the times of testing, for they are precious.
