Oftentimes, people think that after they become a Christian their life will become better. After beginning to love the Lord it is easy to then think, “Lord, look how much I have given you, what do you have to offer in return?” When hard times come, we begin to question the Lord, His love, His justice, and in turn even His existence. Yet, in those moments is often when we can get to know our Lord the most, experience His molding hand, His tender embrace, the depths of His love, and His boundless grace. It is then that we realize how colorful our life can be when we follow the Lord.

If there is one unique person that is the most attractive and colorful, who lived a life in valleys and on mountain tops, among thorns and in green pastures, it is Abraham, (and in succession, Isaac, and Jacob).

> Their lives denote a journey of following the Lord in faith (God the Father), of inheriting all the spiritual riches (God the Son), and of the transforming work (God the Spirit). Our experiences of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are a base or core of all that will come in our Christian life. When we are serious with the Lord, He will give us a “romantic life” following Him–that is, a life of “surprise with affection, with love, even with the operation of love.”

This kind of life is one filled with many little journeys, which eventually compound to become one journey, our journey of life with the Lord. 

This series will look specifically at the life of Abraham, the father of faith, and the many experiences he went through in responding to the calling of God. From Ur to Haran, Shechem, Bethel, Ai, Egypt, and Hebron, all the places Abraham went to or passed through are filled with rich significance for our own journey with the Lord. His life of faith was not something that was developed overnight, but through every experience, trial, and temptation, through the never-ending mercies of the Lord, eventually grew in him a faith that is a pattern for us to follow. May his life inspire and enlighten us, whether we are a new seeker or a believer of many years, to give ourselves to God, not doubting in unbelief, but being empowered by faith, giving glory to God, being fully persuaded that what God has promised He is able to do (cf. Romans 4:20-21)
