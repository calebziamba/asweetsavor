_Draw me; we will run after you._ _The king has brought me into his chambers. We will rejoice in you and be glad; We will extol your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you._ _— The Song of Songs 1:4_

When you have this kind of fellowship with the Lord, you can't describe it to others except to Him. This is the experience of “the chambers.” The more you have this experience, the more you are able to walk the way of the Lord. Each one who loves the Lord has his own experience of the King's chambers. Your experience in this regard is for no one else. In this place, the Lord reveals things that are for you and Him alone. If you abide in this experience, in the inner chamber of your spirit, you will grow in your relationship with the Lord.

We will not grow if we are always busy in the outer court. We all must be in the chambers and have this special relationship with the Lord. Only such persons can really follow the Lord. Therefore, we shouldn't focus on our works so much. Instead, we should spend more time in the King's chambers.
