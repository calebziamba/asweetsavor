_“How beautiful you are, my darling,  
How beautiful you are!”  
– Song of Songs 1:15  
_

Few of us can elicit such a praise from the Lord. We usually think that our experience of the Lord’s life is somehow adequate. But we should consider soberly before Him, how much do we really give the Lord? How much desire do we really have for the Lord? Or do we just focus on our work or on what others think of us? We need to remember that no matter how busy we are, we still have to live in the “night,” experiencing the Lord’s death to love Him in a deeper way. No matter how much we labor or how zealous we are, we still need to remain in Engedi, enjoying the Lord as our fountain and our shelter. Then the Lord will say that we are beautiful. May the Lord enlighten us and reveal His intent and pleasure to us.
