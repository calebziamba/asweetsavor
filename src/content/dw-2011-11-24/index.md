_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

Brothers and sisters, when you do not have the presence of the Lord, it is much easier for you to respond. Without the Lord’s presence, it is so dry that you would like to leave that situation immediately. Then when the Lord asks you to go, you would follow Him without any hesitation.

In this situation, however, the seeker is not weak or dry. She has the presence of the Lord. Everything is so sweet, so glorious, and so prevailing. Even “the vines are in blossom.” When everything is so bright and wonderful, and the Lord says, “Rise up, my love,” it is really hard for you to respond to His calling.
