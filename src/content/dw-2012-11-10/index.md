"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."  
— John 12:24_

_To Timothy, my genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord._  
_— First Timothy 1:2_

It means nothing to say, “That brother is my fruit. He is my son.” The son knows who his father really is. The father may not be perfect, he may not always be right, but still he is the father. The son knows his father.

We must bear fruit by taking the Lord’s way, which is to fall into the ground to die. As we fall into the ground and die, we are joyful, because we expect to bear much fruit.
