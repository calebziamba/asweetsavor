_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

_The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him._ _– Romans 8:16-17_

After we have been saved for a period of time, we can testify that all our experiences, whether sweet or bitter, are used by the Spirit to bring us into our inheritance. Our enjoyment of our inheritance comes from our experience. The Spirit is always ready to reveal to us all that we have inherited in Christ for our enjoyment. Our experience and enjoyment of our inheritance comes by means of revelation. The more revelation we have, the more we enjoy our inheritance. The more revelation we receive, the more riches we have.
