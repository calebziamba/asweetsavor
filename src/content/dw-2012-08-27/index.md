_“Who is this coming up from the wilderness_ _Like pillars of smoke,_ _Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,_ _With all scented powders of the merchant?”_ _There is Solomon’s bed._ _Sixty mighty men surround it,_ _Of the mighty men of Israel.”_ _— Song of Songs 3:6-7_

The one who comes up from the wilderness becomes Solomon’s bed, where Solomon can rest. The Lord, as the greater Solomon, enjoys and gains rest in His believers.
