_Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power. â€” Colossians 1:27b-29_

You must possess high expectations and high revelations. Anyone who does not have high expectations will be destined to live a low life, and anyone who does not have high revelations will be destined to remain common. If you possess high expectations and revelations, you will be able to minister in such a way that people will be ushered into the economy of God.

You can see this principle in Paul's labor on behalf of the Colossians 1:27b-29. Paul possessed both high revelations and high expectations. He saw the church and the glory of God's economy. He saw the church as the Body of Christ, and that God's economy was carried out through the church. He labored, however, with each saint in order to present each saint full-grown in Christ. His ministering brought people into the economy of God.

Paul did not fulfill his ministry merely by giving messages. He labored with the saints individually so that he could present every one of them full-grown in Christ.
