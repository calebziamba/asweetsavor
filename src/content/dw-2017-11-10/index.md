_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

It is God who places us together in the body just as He desires (1 Cor. 12:18), yet as we begin to strive to carry out something for the Lord, we may do so without any fear and trembling that we might grumble or dispute.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; page 123.
