_A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless the Lord, all servants of the Lord, Who serve by night in the house of the Lord! Lift up your hands to the sanctuary And bless the Lord! May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth. — Psalm 134:1-3_

The psalm continues, “Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord” (v. 2). To lift up our hands is to pray. In the church life we should be those who pray and who bless the Lord.

This phrase, “Bless the Lord,” is precious. When we are immature it seems that we are always asking for the Lord to bless us. But after all of our previous experiences there is now a corporate testimony. There is a display of maturity in the church life in which we lift up our hands, interceding and praying for the Lord to come back. As we pray for the Lord’s return we say, “Lord, we bless You.” By our maturity we have become a blessing to the Lord.
