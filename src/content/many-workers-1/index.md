> Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:17 NASB

The Lord’s work is being carried out by many groups of workers. All the Lord’s workers in their various groups should be laboring toward the same goal: that we may all gain Christ. Anyone who is struggling toward this same goal is a worthy pattern.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 227
