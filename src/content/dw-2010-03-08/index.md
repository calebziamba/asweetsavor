_And He said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'' — Matthew 22:37_ You have to cultivate a will that is absolute for the Lord, to the extent that nothing else can turn you aside. For example, a brother may consecrate himself to the Lord and desire to serve full-time. However, after being offered a job with a good salary, he takes it. That indicates that his will is not adequately equipped. He does not know how to give himself for Christ and the church. He should have followed the Lord’s leading, but his will lacked equipping.

Brothers, we all love the Lord in our emotion. The problem is that many are wild in their minds, and not equipped in their wills. This is the typical situation.

Suppose a brother is laid off from his job, and after a thorough consideration he decides to serve the Lord full-time. After making this decision, he receives a number of phone calls offering him jobs. If he feels these phone calls are a confirmation that the Lord wants him to serve Him, this indicates that he has a proper will. Your ability to serve the Lord depends upon whether or not your will is equipped.
