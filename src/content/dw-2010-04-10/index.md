We have the goal of getting people saved, and so does Christianity. Our gospel may be higher than the one preached in Christianity, but we also rejoice in seeing people saved. We should not despise such a burden, for God desires all men to be saved, and that none would be lost.

However, for us, the higher and more spiritual the process, the better. To those in Christianity, the goal often justifies the means. For us, however, the means we use to gain others must match our goal; they must be spiritual.
