_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

Our following the Lord is based on God’s initiating and appearing. The more He appears to us, the healthier and more absolute our Christian walk becomes. We no longer find it hard to walk His way. Our Christian work and service are no longer heavy but light (Matt. 11:28–30). We see only the Lord.
