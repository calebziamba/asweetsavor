_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

God is strict with us. He doesn’t want the love of the world to hold us back. When the Lord Jesus asked some to follow Him, they made excuses: “But he said, ‘Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.’ But He said to him, ‘Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God.’ Another also said, ‘I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say good-bye to those at home.’ But Jesus said to him, ‘No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God’” (Luke 9:59–62).
