_The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, “Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.”_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

When Abraham eventually left Ur, he got as far as Haran, which is north of Canaan, and dwelt there. It seems that Abraham was not very clear about what he was doing. He knew God wanted him to move, but he didn’t know where. Then God appeared to him again and told him, “Go forth from your country...to the land which I will show you” (Gen. 12:1).
