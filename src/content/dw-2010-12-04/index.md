_At my first defense no one was with me to support me, but all abandoned me. May it not be counted against them. But the Lord stood with me and empowered me that through me the proclamation of the gospel might be fully accomplished and all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the lion's mouth. — 2 Timothy 4:16-17_ The Lord stood with Paul; this is extremely sweet. The one who stands with the Lord is also able to enjoy the Lord standing with him. The one who consecrates himself to the Lord is also able to enjoy the consecration of the Lord to him. Paul could say, “I am one with the Lord, and the Lord is one with me.” When we declare, “Lord, I am Yours,” the Lord will declare back, “I am yours also.”
