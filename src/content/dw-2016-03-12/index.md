_Then the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”_ _– Genesis 6:3_

The flesh is not manifested suddenly. One day the Lord might lead us to pursue an advanced degree so that we are better equipped to serve Him. After we have our degree, we see others using their degree to start their own business, so we do the same. Others buy a grand house, so we do also. Others buy good cars, and we follow their example. Eventually our flesh is fully manifested.
