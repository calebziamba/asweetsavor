> But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place. For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish; to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life.
> 
> 2 Corinthians 2:14-16, ASV

When we follow the Lord Jesus and live in His presence, we begin to manifest a certain kind of smell -- a savor of Christ. The apostle Paul was one such person so saturated with Christ and so genuinely in the presence of Christ that his life was a manifestation of this savor.
