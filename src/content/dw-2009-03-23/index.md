_Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light;Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. — Colossians. 1:12-13_

When we were born again, we received an entirely new position. We have seen that our former position was truly hopeless and miserable. We were in darkness, we were under the authority of Satan, we were in sin, and we were in death. We were under God's judgment and therefore condemned. We were slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness, and we were children of wrath and sons of disobedience. As fallen and sinful human beings, all of us needed a positional change.

According to the Bible we have been delivered from our old position and transferred into a wonderful new position (Col. 1:13). We should not underestimate the significance of receiving a new position, because our position will determine what kind of living we will have. Being born again is like migrating from one country to another. It is like migrating from a poverty-stricken country, where there is no hope, to a rich and prosperous country with unlimited hope for the future. We are now in a new “country,” a new kingdom with so many riches. Spiritually we have migrated from the kingdom of Satan to the kingdom of God. Now in our new position we can enjoy all the marvelous riches which God has prepared for us. In the next two chapters we will cover thirty wonderful aspects of our position after being born again.
