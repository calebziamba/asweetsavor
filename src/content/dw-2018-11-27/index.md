_But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know._ _– 1 John 2:20_

As we teach, we dispense Christ into the believers as life. Our teaching should help others advance in their practical living by ushering them into a higher spiritual sphere.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 152.
