> Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
> 
> \- Hebrews 10:8

\[God\] passed through a process for His economy, but it did not involve His becoming different in Who He is. The Son pre-existed creation, and when we were created, we were created in His image. God the Son existed in eternity. He was there in eternity without change, and in time He passed through a process for the sake of redemption. But He Himself never changed, for He is eternal.
