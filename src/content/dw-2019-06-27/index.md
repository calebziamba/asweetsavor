_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

Who can help others to love the Lord? Only those  
who are in the experience of the Lord’s love, who are  
in “the king’s chambers.”  
  
If we are permeated with the Lord’s love and are  
enjoying a sweet relationship with Him in our spirit,  
it will be easy for us to help others love the Lord.  
Those who meet us will realize that the love of the  
Lord is better than wine. Our fresh enjoyment in love  
causes others to rediscover this love for themselves.
