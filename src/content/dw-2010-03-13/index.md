_Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing? — Matthew 6:25_ Some people are particular about what food they buy. They will not buy anything except the choicest meat. If the Lord provides, you can eat whatever you want, but why waste your mind on this? It is not a sin to eat well, but you should not waste your mind, emotion, and will on such things. You should be simple and live a simple life for the Lord.

We should equip ourselves and treasure our mind, emotion and will, building them into a strong wall that nothing can penetrate. When we have such a heart, we are able to pursue the Lord with our entire being. May the Lord have mercy.
