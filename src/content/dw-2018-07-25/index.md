_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Judicial redemption is not the end of our Christian life. When we obtain God’s judicial redemption through faith, the life of God is also put into us. Thus, we become the children of God.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 14.
