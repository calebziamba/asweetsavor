_Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”_ _– John 14:6_

Suppose we wake up in the morning and simply feel down. There’s no need to remain in such a state, and we don’t need to condemn ourselves, saying, “Oh, I’m so poor. I’m so weak.” We just need to turn to the Lord and enjoy Christ as life.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 86.
