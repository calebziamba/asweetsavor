_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

There are two major sections in Romans dealing with organic salvation. The first (Rom. 5–8) emphasizes our inner life, while the second (Rom. 12–16) emphasizes our outward living.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 17.
