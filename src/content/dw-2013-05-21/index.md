The Lord cannot work on you apart from your personality. Your personality determines your serving and your effectiveness before the Lord. Your personality is more important than your knowledge of the Bible, your spiritual experience, or the vision and revelation you have received.

Your knowledge of the Bible is useful, but it is not the primary factor that determines your usefulness. Your subjective experience of the Lord is likewise useful. The vision and revelation of Godâ€™s economy you have received is also useful and vital, but of itself it is not sufficient.

The effectiveness of these things through you is subject to a condition: everything depends upon your personality. We might think that a man with knowledge of the Bible, spiritual experience, and rich revelation should be very useful to the Lord. But in fact, it is his personality that will determine his spiritual development.
