_“Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? Where do you make it lie down at noon?” For why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?” —Song of Songs 1:7_ Her prayer is very good here. Although she is wandering astray as one veiled beside the flocks of the companions of the Lord, not knowing what her portion is, she still is seeking the Lord with all her heart.

We need to pray from time to time, “Please tell me, Lord, where is the fullest rest and the richest nourishment? I am not satisfied nor at rest. How can I enjoy You more? How can I know You more?”
