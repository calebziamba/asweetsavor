_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

The third aspect of being a seed is to have a certain kind of readiness. First, the seed should be hidden, which means that it is buried. Second, the seed should be full of life. Finally, as we shall now consider, the seed should be ready to grow and bear fruit.

The proper understanding of being a seed is to say, “God has dug a deep hole and buried me. But while I am hidden here, I will enjoy the riches of life, and then I will be ready to grow and bear fruit.” The seed is always seeking the opportunity to grow and bear fruit.
