_And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. — John 17:22-23_ The Son prayed in life to the Father that the Father’s life and nature would bring the believers into the reality of oneness in the same way that the Father and the Son experienced such a oneness. However, for something so profound to happen, there needs to be a particular process that all the believers enjoy, realize, and substantiate according to this marvelous prayer. In the coming days we shall consider the various aspects of this process.
