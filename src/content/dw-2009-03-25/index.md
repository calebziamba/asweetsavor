_But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. — First Corinthians 6:17_

_That which is born of the flesh is flesh, but that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. — John 3:6_

Before we were born again we were in Satan's kingdom, under the authority of darkness. When the Lord Jesus commissioned Paul to preach the gospel to the nations, He told Paul to “open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God” (Acts 26:18).

When we were born again, God “delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love” (Col. 1:13). In our new position we are delivered from Satan's authority, the authority of darkness.

In our new position we are joined to the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). When we were born again, we were born of the Spirit of God. (John 3:6). The Lord Jesus is now the Spirit: “And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Cor. 3:17). The Lord as the Spirit is one with our human spirit, the deepest part of our being: “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God” (Rom. 8:16). After being born again, our new position is that we are joined to the Lord in our spirit.
