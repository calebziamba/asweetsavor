_Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the fields of Jaar. Let us go into His tabernacle; Let us worship at His footstool. Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. — Psalm 132:6-8_ After the reality of God’s tabernacle is produced, the psalmist continues, “Arise, O Jehovah, unto Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your strength” (v. 8). In verse six the psalmist said, “We found it \[the ark\] in the fields of Jaar.” In other words, by his struggling the psalmist produced the ark of testimony, the reality and substance of the Lord’s habitation.

This means that he has provided the Lord a way to enter into His resting place. He can now tell the Lord, “Arise, O Jehovah, unto Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your strength.” In this verse the Lord finds His rest. Here He is finally satisfied. He can say, “I have gained My building. I have gained My testimony. I have gained what I have desired. Now I can rest.”
