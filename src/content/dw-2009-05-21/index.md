_For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's cultivated land, God's building. — First Corinthians 3:9_

In our new position we have become God's cultivated land (1 Cor. 3:9). We have become God's farm, the ground that He tills and works on in order for life to grow. God works on us as His cultivated land so that His life can grow in us.

“For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's cultivated land, God's building” (1 Cor. 3:9). God is doing something with us all the time. On one hand God is tilling us so that His life can grow in us. On the other hand God is building us together to be His corporate testimony.
