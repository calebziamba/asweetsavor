_I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. â€”Romans 12:1_ In this verse Paul makes two striking statements concerning the church life. To present our bodies as one living sacrifice is the hardest thing in the practice of the church life. To present our bodies is somewhat easy, but to present our bodies as one and only one living sacrifice is difficult. Out of one thousand people, there are one thousand desires. Some desire the Lord, some desire the out-resurrection, and some desire a good message. But here in Romans it says to present your body according to one desire, the desire to become a living sacrifice.
