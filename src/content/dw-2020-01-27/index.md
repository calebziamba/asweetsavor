_"It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance,  
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,  
among whom I am foremost of all."  
\- 1 Timothy 1:15  
_

Even as we kneel before the Lord, we dare not lift up our eyes to heaven. We can only bow down before Him. We wish we could shrink so small that God could not see us. Yet we feel His light and know He is there. At this moment, we cry, repent, confess, and feel remorse. This is the time God brings us to another realm. We can tell God from the depths of our heart, “I surrender to You completely, even though there is nothing in me that can stand before You or please You. There is nothing in me to be appreciated. I am rotten from within to without.” This becomes a turning point in our experience.
