_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

When we set our heart on something other than God or seek something other than what God is seeking, we inevitably become a part of this perverse generation. What a frustration this is to God’s plan for man! Instead of being distracted from Christ and conformed to this age, let us run the race set before us to win the crown (1 Cor. 9:24–25; Rev. 2:10).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 126.
