I would like to give you an illustration. How should a husband walk into the room when his wife is sleeping? This is not a small thing. If my wife is sleeping, and I go into the room to get something and wake her up, it is a problem of my character, not my nature. However, if I purposely rouse her up, that would indicate a problem in my nature. Some have a nature that cannot tolerate other peopleâ€™s happiness. Our nature should experience transformation after we are saved. The transformed nature produces, through our character, a useful personality.
