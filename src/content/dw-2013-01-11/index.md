_“Who is this coming up from the wilderness_ _Like columns of smoke,_ _Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,_ _With all scented powders of the merchant?”_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

In the chapter 1 of the Song of Songs, the seeker discovered how sweet it is to live a life of love with the Lord. In chapter 2, she came to treasure the banqueting house, the church. Now, as one who desires to be a blessing to the church, she realizes she has to live in “the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense” (4:6) in order to be perfumed with death and resurrection and become a pillar of smoke (3:6). Only through the work of the cross, through death and resurrection, can she truly satisfy God, testify in the church, and become a genuine lover of the Lord.
