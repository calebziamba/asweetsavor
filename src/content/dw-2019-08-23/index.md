_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

When you see some saints in the church, you just feel they are shining and glorious and that there are many crowns upon them. This is the result of God’s special work with them through the cross, by which He has made them plaits of gold.
