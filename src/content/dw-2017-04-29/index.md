 _Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land._ _– Genesis 12:10_

Though the Lord will never leave us, our sensation is that He has. Though we are receiving a spiritual supply, our sensation is that we are not. Just as Abraham ran to Egypt due to a famine, we may turn to the world.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 94.
