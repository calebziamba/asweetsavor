_“For your love is better than wine.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2_

How do we live this life of the song of songs? We have to ask ourselves, “Do I still have any wine that is better than His love?”

If we have a healthy pursuing life, we will have a deep feeling that there is nothing better than the rich love of the Lord. No matter how attractive or glorious something in the world may seem, the Lord’s love is so much better. Whenever we touch the Lord, we can testify, “Lord, Your love is better than any wine on this earth.”
