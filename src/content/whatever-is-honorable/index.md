> Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
> 
> \- Philippians 4:8

One time I heard two young Christians talking. One commented on a certain prayer which was particularly filled  
with the Spirit. The other responded that he too was so helped by that prayer. When I heard this, I was happy, for these two were learning to appreciate that which was dignified. We must broaden our ability to value things and not be narrow in our interest. We all need to appreciate the heavenly things manifested through others for these are the result of the operation of the divine life within them.

What people should see in us is an attractive and inviting dignity. We should not try to impress them with our talent or knowledge of the Bible. We should be approachable and manifest a dignity that issues from God’s life within us.
