_“You are altogether beautiful, my darling,_ _And there is no blemish in you._ _Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:7-8_

We also are called to proceed with the Lord from the top of Hermon, which refers to destruction. Christ has overcome the power of sin and destroyed the enemy’s power through His cross (Heb. 2:14). We have to wield the overcoming power of the Lord’s cross to destroy the enemy.
