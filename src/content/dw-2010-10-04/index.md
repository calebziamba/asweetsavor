_“Write this for a memorial in the book and recount it in the hearing of Joshua.” — Exodus 17:14_

Joshua was totally committed to the Lord and to His interest. Because of this, he was chosen to fight against Amalek. In the process, he learned it was Moses’ prayer, representing the interceding Christ, that was responsible for the victory. Our actions are needed, but apart from the intercession of Christ they are in vain. It is Christ who wins each victory. This must impress us from the very beginning of our service. As the psalmist wrote, “Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it” (Psa. 127:1). Although the Lord graciously credited Joshua with the victory, Joshua was clear he was not truly responsible for it. It was the Lord who gained the victory through Moses’ prayer with the support of Aaron and Hur.

Because God knows how easily we forget, He instructed Moses, saying, “Write this for a memorial in the book and recount it in the hearing of Joshua” (Exo. 17:14). This was to remind Joshua that, although he would serve and fight for the Lord’s interests all his life according to his great abilities and gifts, God would determine the outcome. No matter how smart or capable Joshua was in his warfare with Amalek, until Moses raised his hands, nothing worked. If we gain a victory for the Lord, it is because the Lord is already the Victor, not because we are so wonderful. If we are successful in some situation, it is because Christ is on the throne. Therefore, the first lesson we must learn as we seek to serve the Lord is that it is His intercession, not our ability, that wins the victory.
