_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’”_ _–  Acts 7:2-3_

Even though Abraham failed and became faithless, God was able to make him stand (Rom. 14:4). Since God has chosen us, we don’t need to be afraid of our weaknesses. If God has appeared to us, He will also enable us to stand.
