_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?”_

_“My beloved extended his hand through the opening,_ _And my feelings were aroused for him.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:3-4_

We have to be saved from our work, from our serving, and from our helping others, realizing that the Lord’s head is full of dew, and His locks are full of the drops of the night. He is hungry and thirsty. He has no place to stay. He is still mocked and reproached by people. He has no rest, no way to accomplish His desire.
