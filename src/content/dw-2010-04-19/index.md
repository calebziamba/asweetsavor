_It happened in the middle of the night that Boaz was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet. He said, "Who are you?" She answered, "I am Ruth your maidservant. So spread your covering over your maidservant, for you are a close relative." — Ruth 3:8-9

_The wing of Boaz was, to Ruth, the wing of Jehovah that Boaz spoke of in 2:12. Ruth seemed to be saying, “Spread your wing over your maidservant. You said that I came to seek refuge under Jehovah’s wing. Now I am taking refuge under your wing as the wing that Jehovah has provided.”

Today the Lord is spreading His wing over us. He has promised to be our Savior. Based on this we now come to Him and say, “I give my whole being to You so that I may receive Your full salvation. You must become much more than just my Savior. O Lord, I want to take all that You have done, all that You are, and all that You have, and become totally saturated with You. Do You think I am merely coming to You for a refuge? No! I am coming here to possess You.”
