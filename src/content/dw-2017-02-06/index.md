_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

The church in Philippi had a very sweet relationship with the apostle Paul. They stood with him for the furtherance of the gospel and cared for him financially (Phil. 1:5; 4:15). They loved the Lord, the gospel, and the apostle who served them.
