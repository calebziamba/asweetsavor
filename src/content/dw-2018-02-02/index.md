_Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”_ _– John 14:6_

If we are short of the enjoyment of Christ as our life, in our experience everything will become gloomy, and nothing of Christ will be appealing to us. We will tell the Lord, “Lord, I know so many things about You, but they are not real to me. I know that you are my Lord and that You take care of me, but I don’t really feel anything. I know that You are ‘all in all’ and that I should be joyful, but I cannot be joyful.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 86.
