As you learn to serve in the church, you need to be observant. You need the ability to discriminate and differentiate things spiritually, and you need the ability to observe people and practical things.

Observation is related to your being and personality. You must learn to observe who has grown a lot lately and who has stopped growing, who is joyful and who is under pressure, which couple has been praying together and which couple just had a fight. If you donâ€™t develop this skill when you are young, you cannot serve the Lord.
