"The Lord Jesus Christ is gracious, and in His grace, we have Him. In His grace, we have Him abiding in us. In His grace, we can be one with Him. In His grace, we can grow in Him. In His grace, we can live by Him and with Him. In His grace, we can enjoy Him and partake of Him. In His grace, we are short of nothing because we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit, who is just Christ Himself. We should be happy that we are in this new covenant."
