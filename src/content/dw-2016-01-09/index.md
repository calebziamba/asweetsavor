In our experience, these eight expressions of life recorded in Genesis 5 are not eight consecutive steps but are simultaneous. From these eight expressions, we can see how God has blessed us with the riches of His grace and glory. These riches are ours to enjoy. May we live in the line of life. May the Spirit write this word in us as our lifelong vision and goal. If we have these eight expressions, we are todayâ€™s Seth appointed by God to fulfill His will.
