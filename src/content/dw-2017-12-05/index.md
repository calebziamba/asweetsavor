_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

Satan uses the world to shape people’s hearts and lives so that they end up far from God and His intention. Right now Satan is looking at all the little children and planning a further development of the world to match them. We should not consider this a light matter. People created by God, bright with promise, become captured by professions and careers, a part of the material world. These bend them, taking them far from God’s intended goal. They do not develop according to all that is possible for them in God’s plan, but rather the potential of their human lives is funneled away by something vain.
