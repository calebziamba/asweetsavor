_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going._ _– Hebrews 11:8_

When the Lord appears to us, He leads us to live a life of faith and walk by faith, which is beyond all reason. We feel we should go this way, and there is an inward urging to go forward, so we keep on walking. As we do so, we experience God as our way.
