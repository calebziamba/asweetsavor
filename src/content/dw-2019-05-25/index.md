_“Thy name is as ointment poured forth.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

Initially, when we began to love the Lord, all that we sought was the enjoyment of His love. Gradually, the Lord constituted Himself into us. During this time, He was so tender. He did not come to us as the shining light to judge us. He came to us with His tender love so we could experience the anointing oil within. Even in our weakness, we still could experience His tender compassion, dealing, leading, and guiding.

He continued to work in us so that we could know His work of redemption and salvation accomplished on our behalf. Eventually, we came to know the Lord who loved us, went to the cross for us, died for us, resurrected for us, and who now lives in us to become our life.

Now He is our joy, our satisfaction, our enjoyment, our supply, and our strength. What we experience now is the work of the Lord in His name, a name that is “like ointment poured forth.” Even so, at this point our experience still has not touched the depths of who He is.
