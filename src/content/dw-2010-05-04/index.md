_I have given them Your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world. â€” John 17:14_ Just as the Son of God was not of this world, so also we are not of this world . The world has nothing to do with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the world, and we want nothing to do with this present evil age. So the first thing needed to keep the oneness in the church is to not be a part of the world.
