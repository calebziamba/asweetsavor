_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

A brother may pray a good prayer with spiritual expectation: “Lord Jesus, I am willing to serve You. I want to save souls, supply life, and speak in the church meetings. I hope to be equipped, to be useful, to be manifested, to raise up churches, and to have the ability to preach the gospel!” A sister may pray a good prayer filled with spiritual hope: “Lord Jesus, I want to be able to care for people. I want to be able to visit the saints, to help others, and to manifest a steadfast love in the church!” All of the things in these prayers are good, but the brother and sister may be seeking these things rather than Christ Himself. Even in such positive prayers, we may not have Christ.
