_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

 _Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed. Therefore let us celebrate the feast.... — First Corinthians 5:7-8_

In the process of our growth in life, we should often experience a deep touch with the Lord. When we touch Him, we touch holiness. Then something happens—a wonderful joyfulness comes in. We experience a spiritual feasting and celebration. When we take just twenty minutes to abide in Christ through prayer or reading the Bible, we become joyful. We lose ourselves in Christ. This is a celebration. He becomes so precious to us, and we become so precious to Him. God and we enjoy Christ as our mutual feast. We are saints, the holy ones. As such, we are enjoying a feast and a celebration.
