> But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
> 
> â€” Philippians 3:13b-14 ESV

When we first became Christians, perhaps our goal was simply to read the Bible. When we grew a bit more, our goal may have become to enjoy the Lord in our daily life. As we pursued this, we saw something more, and our goal advanced again. There is no such thing as retirement for a Christian, for there is always something further for us to pursue in our experience of Christ.
