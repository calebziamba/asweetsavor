_Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace. â€” Ephesians 2:15_ Ephesians tells us that in the church as the new man the law of commandments in ordinances has been abolished (Eph. 2:15). This indicates that in the church we should not place demands upon the saints. We should not give others the feeling that there are many requirements among us. All such things have been abolished! Instead of a demanding church life, we should have a church life where everyone is supplied and happy!
