> And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, Are by no means least among the leaders of Judah; For from you will come forth a Ruler Who will shepherd My people Israel
> 
> \- Matthew 2:6

"Bethlehem" means "house of food, a house of supply." ...We say, "Wow, that's marvelous! The Lord Jesus is from Bethlehem!" So the Lord Jesus is ready to be our supply with all the riches of all kinds of food. ...Eventually, what is the outcome? You also become part of Bethlehem. You also become a life supply to many brothers and sisters in the church life.
