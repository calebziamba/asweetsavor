_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?”_

_“My beloved extended his hand through the opening,_ _And my feelings were aroused for him.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:3-4_

In chapter 4, the seeker ravished the Lord’s heart with one glance of her eyes (4:9). Here He ravishes our hearts by showing us His hand.

In this stage, the maiden doesn’t mention anything to the daughters of Jerusalem, for she has entered into depths of experience where companions are unable to help anymore.
