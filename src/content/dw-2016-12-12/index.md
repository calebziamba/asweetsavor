_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1_

This land was the land of Canaan. God seemed to be telling him, “Leave everything you are familiar with. From now on, I will be your portion, and you will experience Me and gain Me.”
