_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! — John 1:29_

What kind of person is this Christ? In other words, what are the riches of Christ that we may enjoy? The riches of Christ include hundreds of items. We will begin by looking at six items from the Gospel of John.

First, Christ is the Lamb of God. “The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29). How do we enjoy Christ as the Lamb? We enjoy Him by realizing that all our sins are taken away. All our sins are not merely forgiven and covered, but they are even taken away. This is true not only of the sins we committed yesterday, but even of the sins that we will commit 20 years from now. The sins in our future have already been taken away by the Lord as the Lamb of God. We should all tell the Lord, “Lord, I am so happy. I can enjoy You as the Lamb, as my Redeemer. All my sins have been taken away. Hallelujah! There is nothing left.” How about the sins we will commit several years from now? Those sins have already been taken away.

We should learn to worship the Lord in our spirit this way. “Praise the Lord, I have the Lamb of God! This Lamb takes away all my sins, not only in the past, not only today, but even in the future. All my sins have been taken care of. The more I enjoy Christ, the more I feel sinless. The more I enjoy Christ, the more I'm released from the burden of sin. The more I enjoy Christ, the more I'm set apart from the world. All the negative things in the universe are taken care of by my enjoyment of the Lamb of God. This is wonderful! Hallelujah!”
