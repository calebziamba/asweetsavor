_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

Not only did the Lord “not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped” (v. 6), He also “emptied Himself” (v. 7). This is somewhat like a father who lets go of all sense of dignity as he gives his young daughter a ride on his shoulders. He happily lifts her up and allows her to steer him around the house by pulling his hair. In this way he empties himself.
