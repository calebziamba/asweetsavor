When your house functions well, any young person should feel free to walk in and eat with your family, even if it is only hot dogs. You should not feel pressured because you are not serving them steak and potatoes. They should not feel that they are bothering you. When there is a sense of family among the saints and among the young people, then many weaknesses will get swallowed up instead of being magnified.
