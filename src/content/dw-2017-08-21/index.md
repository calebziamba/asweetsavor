_So He said to him, “Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away._ _– Genesis 15:9-11_

In Genesis 15, Abraham offered a heifer, a female goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon to God (vv. 9–10). Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and he drove them away (v. 11). This signifies that Satan will attack our sacrifices, and we must chase him away by faith (James 4:7; Eph. 6:16).
