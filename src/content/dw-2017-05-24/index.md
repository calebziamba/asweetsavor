If we are waiting to go to heaven the Lord might say to us, “One day the holy city, New Jerusalem, will come down out of heaven to the earth (Rev. 21:10). At that time I will display and exhibit all My riches for eternity. However, I do not want you to wait for the New Jerusalem and miss your opportunity to enjoy Me today. I want you to have a wonderful foretaste today of the New Jerusalem. I want you to enjoy all My riches in your living today.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 71.
