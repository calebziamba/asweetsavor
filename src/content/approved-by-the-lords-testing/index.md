> For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it. For there also have to be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you.
> 
> 1 Corinthians 11:18-19

When you are in the church, it seems it is only a matter of time before you encounter factions. Every time we come face to face with such divisiveness, we should be aware that it is a testing of the Lord, so that those who are approved may become evident. Through His testing, we can know whether we are experienced, whether we are in life, and whether we know what we are doing. If we do not know, then we must turn to the Lord and repent.
