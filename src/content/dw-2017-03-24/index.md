_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed._ _– Hebrews 11:8_

We should tell the Lord, “Have mercy on me. I want to walk in You. You are my way. I never want to leave You. Without You I have no way. I don’t preach the gospel just to preach. I don’t read the Bible just to read. I don’t serve the church just to serve. My life, my work, my speech—my entire walk—are for me to gain You.” Whoever has this experience is following the way of Abraham.
