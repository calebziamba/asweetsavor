_But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ. â€” Philippians 3:7-8_ What is left after you are freed from both the material and the religious worlds? When the flow of the divine stream does its job, there is nothing left for us except Christ. There is no other hope! There is no other goal! There is nothing except the glory of God. A person who experiences this flow simply desires Christ to be magnified. If this is your case, you are truly experiencing the flow of the divine stream. Those who are genuinely in the divine flow can say that they are no longer preoccupied with things of the material and religious world.
