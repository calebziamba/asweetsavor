_He blessed him and said,_

_“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,_ _Possessor of heaven and earth;_ _And blessed be God Most High,_ _Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”_ _– Genesis 14:19-20_

After receiving God’s promise concerning the good land, Abraham went forth and arrived at Hebron, a heavenly realm, and lived a life of fellowship with God (Gen. 13:18). Following this, war broke out between four kings and five kings, resulting in Lot being carried off with all of Sodom as battle spoils. When Abraham heard of this, he fought against the kings and overcame them (14:12–16).

After Abraham’s victory, Melchisedec, king of Salem and priest of God Most High, blessed Abraham (14:19–20). As Possessor of heaven and earth, God has authority over heaven and earth. Melchisedec indicated that Abraham’s overcoming life came from God’s authority.
