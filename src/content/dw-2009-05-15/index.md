_So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. — Ephesians 2:19_

We saw previously that we have been transferred into God's kingdom. In God's kingdom there are many fellow citizens, which are all the believers in Christ (Eph. 2:19). If the Lord were to speak to all of us at once, it is possible He would not begin, “My dear brothers and sisters.” Instead He may begin, “My dear fellow citizens.” Why? Because we are all in the same kingdom, and we all share the same citizenship. All who believe in the Lord Jesus are fellow citizens. This shows us again that our new position is a corporate one. It is foolish to think that we can be individualistic after we are born again. This is absolutely wrong. In our new position we are fellow citizens with the saints in the kingdom of God.
