_And a river went forth from Eden to water the whole garden, and from there it divided and became four branches. The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. — Genesis 2:11-12_

_Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever, but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up unto eternal life. — John 4:14_

_And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. — Revelation 22:1_ We must see that, according to His word, God does indeed operate as a flow. What a great revelation this is! That God works as a divine stream is evident from Genesis to Revelation. God's divine operation is in the principle of flowing.

In other words, God's work is filled with enjoyment and nourishment. It is not something dry or harsh, nor is it something that is imposed or forced. Regardless of what our concept may be, God's primary means of operation is not something that brings us into suffering. On the contrary, God's operation is something “wet”—it is enjoyable and full of nourishment. This is the first thing implied when God reveals that His operation is to flow as a divine stream.
