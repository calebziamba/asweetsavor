_"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’" Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me." — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

Everything we consider wonderful and are unwilling to let go of will become a problem one day. Our secret of touching the Lord and gaining His presence today will become a hindrance in the future. If you just try to hold on to what you have experienced, you will not grow.
