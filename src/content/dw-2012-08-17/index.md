_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

Where does the impact of the pillars of smoke come from? It comes from being “perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of the merchant.”

According to Watchman Nee, “merchant” is singular, so it refers to the Lord Jesus. The Lord as the Merchant is selling something to us. He is in effect saying, “If you want the blessings of this stage, you must pay a price.”
