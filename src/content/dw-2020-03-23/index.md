_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle"  
\-Romans 1:1  
_

Those in Christ find their existence is Christ, their breath is Christ, their enjoyment is Christ, their living is Christ, and their walking is Christ. Paul even wrote that in Christ we are complete (Col. 2:10).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 38.
