God will raise up all kinds of situations in our environment to test us. We typically complain about these things. We complain that our house is not big enough, that our bed is not soft enough, and that the temperature is too cold or too hot. If we desire to be approved, however, we must be able to receive all the sovereign arrangements God has prepared for us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 147.
