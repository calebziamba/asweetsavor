_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

There is a clear contrast between what Christ did and what Satan did as Lucifer. Christ was equal with God, yet did not hold fast to this equality; Lucifer was not equal with God but sought to seize this equality by force. Lucifer was “the anointed cherub who covers” (Ezek. 28:14). He possessed the highest position in the universe, next to God (vv. 13–15). He desired to establish his throne on the same level as God’s throne; his intention was to be like God (Isa. 14:12–14). He wanted to share in God’s glory.

God had placed Lucifer directly under Himself, but this was not good enough for him. He was not attempting to overthrow God—no one could do that—but he wanted what God had. Because of this, he became Satan, the Adversary (Thayer, pp. 571–572).
