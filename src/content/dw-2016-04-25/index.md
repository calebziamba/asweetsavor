_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose._ _—Philippians 2:2_

Paul desired that the Philippians would fulfill his joy “by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose” (2:2). The way for us to be of the same mind is to have the mind of Christ and to be according to Him (Phil. 2:5, Rom. 15:5). If our focus is on practices and teachings, there will always be differences. Our focus must be on Christ alone if we are going to be “united in spirit, intent on one purpose.”
