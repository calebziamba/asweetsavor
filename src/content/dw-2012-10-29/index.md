"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

The Lord Jesus Himself was an example of being a seed. As the incarnated God He surely had the right to consider Himself as everything, but instead He considered Himself simply as a seed, falling into the ground to die and bear much fruit.

The Lord would say to us today, “My way is different from your way. Your way is to get things done. My way is to die, so that the fruit can be brought forth. Your way is planning, organizing, working, and laboring. My way is simple. I have only one way, and only one thing to do. I just die. I am a seed to be buried, and where I am, My servant will also be. If you want to serve Me, you must be a seed. You must follow Me into the ground to die, and bring forth fruit in resurrection.”
