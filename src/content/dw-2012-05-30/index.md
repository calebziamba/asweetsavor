_“I held on to him and would not let him go Until I Had Brought Him into My Mother’s House  and into the Chamber of Her Who Conceived Me.”_

_“I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, That you will not arouse or awaken my love Until she pleases.” — Song of Songs 3:4b-5_

At this point, after experiencing the abundance of life, being delivered from herself, and beginning to walk the way of the cross, the seeker also begins to manifest the condition of being in union with the Lord.

This is seen in 3:6-11—coming up from the wilderness, like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of the merchant. She also becomes Solomon’s bed, emptying and pouring out herself fully. She is filled with the Lord Himself. Her spiritual condition has advanced, and she has entered a higher degree of manifestation.
