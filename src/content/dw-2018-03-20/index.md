_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

“Holding fast” implies our stand, attitude, and living. It is active and continuous. In order to hold fast the word of life, our stand must be very clear. We may love the Lord and the church, but to hold fast the word of life we must stand firm for what we have seen (see Acts 26:15–19).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 131-132.
