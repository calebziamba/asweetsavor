> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, all who are mature, let’s have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that to you as well; however, let’s keep living \[Gr. __stoicheō__\] by that same _standard_ to which we have attained.

> \-- Philippians 3:14-16 NASB

If someone should attempt to raise certain issues that we find troubling, our response should be, “I respect you and honor you as one whom I believe is seeking to follow the Lord. I hope you would honor the fact that I am seeking to follow the Lord too.” We have the freedom to live before the Lord according to His personal leading. Even though others may attempt to impose things upon us, we must feel free to follow Christ.
