> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
> 
> – Philippians 4:6 (NASB)

Prayer is largely neglected by Christians. We are much more prone to discuss and consider things than to pray about them. Generally, prayer is not as strong among Christians as teaching, preaching, and mutual encouragement. Daily prayer is not commonly practiced. How many speak to the Lord and have fellowship with Him for half an hour every day? This simple matter is woefully short among us. It is because of this that we lack spiritual strength.

I am thankful that when I was a young believer, I was helped to build up a habit of prayer. Gradually it became a part of my person. Today, while doing other things, I pray. This should be an integral part of every Christian’s daily life.
