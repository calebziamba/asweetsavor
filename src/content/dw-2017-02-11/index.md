_Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus...And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._

_—Philippians 2:5,8_

How low Christ became! Christ’s pattern shows us that the way to become a blessing to the church is to become very, very low. This is the secret of spiritual growth and of gaining Christ (Phil. 3:8).

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ,”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 114.
