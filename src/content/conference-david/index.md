_These messages were given to the young saints gathered together for the annual summer training with brother Titus in 2005 from July 27 - August 25 at Montreal, Canada. The content of these messages have been compiled into the book, ["David: After God's Heart"](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-david), which is available for purchase or as a free download._

David was a great king as well as an outstanding servant of the Lord, who fought God's battles and gained the material for the building of God's dwelling place; God Himself says that he was "a man after My own heart" (Acts 13:22). Yet even so, he also had serious failures, for which he suffered very much, and often had difficulty discerning the Lord's desire.

From such a one, who in many respects is like us today, we can learn many unique and very valuable lessons to help us in our own seeking after the Lord's heart.
