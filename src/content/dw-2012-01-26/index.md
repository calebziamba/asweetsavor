_"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away. For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. The flowers have already appeared in the land; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land. The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away!'" â€” Song of Songs 2:10-13_

The voice of the turtledove (2:12) represents love. This love does not only exist between you and the Lord, but also between the Lord and the brothers and sisters. When you hear the voice of the turtledove, you hear the singing and the songs of love. Praise the Lord for the flowers, the singing, and the voice of the turtledove!
