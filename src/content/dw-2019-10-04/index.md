_Epaphroditus \[...\] was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. For indeed he was sick to the point of death - Philippians 2:26–27_

Epaphroditus did not lie on his sick bed hoping the Philippians would send him flowers or words of comfort. It would have been very easy for him to feel he deserved some sympathy, yet he would have preferred to hide his sickness from the church. This is why he longed for them—so he could relieve them, comfort them, and strengthen them. What a manner of life this is! Such an example should affect our care for one another.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 167.
