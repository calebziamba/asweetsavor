_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

Our living should be simple. As long as we are in this world, it will always be tugging at us and seeking a foothold. Something other than Christ will attempt to grow in us to become our boast. If we want to shine as lights, we cannot allow this. When others see us, they must see a shining that comes from another source within. As those who have received Christ, it has been given to us to be His lights.
