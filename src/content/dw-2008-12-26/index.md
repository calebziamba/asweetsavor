_To You I lift up my eyes, O You who are enthroned in the heavens! Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the Lord our God, Until He is gracious to us. — Psalm 123:1-2_

What is the Lord's hand in our experience? It may be a thought or an idea that suddenly comes, or it may be something that happens in our environment. At that moment we have the deep inward realization, “This is the Lord.This is not of man. It is the Lord.” We should have numerous experiences of this. There should be many times when we go through something and realize, “This is Christ. This is not just an environment. This is not just a coincidence. This is not something that simply happened. The Lord is here. This is His hand.”

This psalm gives us a vivid picture of what it is to be consecrated. When the Lord's hand moves, or when His hand is upon us, we have the proper response. In this psalm we first give ourselves to Christ by lifting up our eyes to see Him enthroned in the heavens. When we see Him this way, it is like a servant looking to the hand of his master and a maidservant looking to the hand of her mistress. As consecrated ones we are those who look upon Christ. We are waiting on Him. We are watching for the movement of His hand.
