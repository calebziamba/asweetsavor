_The Lord said to her,_

_“Two nations are in your womb;_ _And two peoples will be separated from your body;_ _And one people shall be stronger than the other;_ _And the older shall serve the younger.”_ _– Genesis 25:23_

Isaac’s third and biggest mistake was his trying to bless Esau. While the twins were still in their mother’s womb, God had prophesied that the older should serve the younger. If Isaac had blessed Esau, the older twin, God’s prophecy and will would have been made void. Even in his blessing he wanted to bless the wrong person. God intervened, and the blessing came to the younger son. Though Isaac made mistake after mistake, God protected him, corrected him, and blessed him in order to fulfill His will.
