_That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._ _– Ephesians 1:18_

Suppose someone were to ask us, “Don’t you still have problems, even after being born again?” We should respond, “I don’t care about my problems. I am in the heavenlies!” Suppose they would go on to say, “But haven’t you been rebellious and disobedient to the Lord?” We should reply, “I don’t see that. I only see that I am in resurrection.” If they remind us, “Haven’t you lost your temper?” we should proclaim, “I don’t know anything about that, but I do know that I am becoming God’s masterpiece.”
