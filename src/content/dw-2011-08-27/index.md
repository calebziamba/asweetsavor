_“Sustain me with cakes of raisins, Refresh me with apples, For I am lovesick. His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me.” — Song of Songs 2:5-6_

_That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height— to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God. Ephesians 3:17-19_ Beyond all these items, she has also discovered that her capacity for experiencing the Lord is limited. Therefore, she is willing to give up her small world and enjoy with all the saints the breadth and length and height and depth of Christ (Eph. 3:18). She not only draws life from the Head, but also receives the supply from the members of the Body. She has become more humble outwardly and been broadened inwardly. Hallelujah!
