Even more wonderful than being a slave of righteousness is being a slave to God. To see this we can refer again to Romans 6:22, which says,

_Now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life._

We have been set free from sin, death, the world, the flesh, and the authority of Satan, and now we are enslaved to God!
