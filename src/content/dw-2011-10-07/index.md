_That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. — Philippians 3:10_

Furthermore, this book is very focused. Paul’s other epistles often deal with a range of topics. All of Paul’s writings focus on Christ, of course, but some require more study than others. In his letter to the Ephesians, for instance, Paul covers the matter of the church in a variety of ways. While this provides a way for Paul to release many riches of the truth, one must exercise a sober mind to receive what is being revealed.

His words to the Philippians, however, are easily grasped, for they all flow from a simple focus, which is the gaining of Christ. Because of the manner in which Paul shares to the church in Philippi, it is fairly easy to comprehend what is shared. Philippians comes to us like a well-prepared meal that is ready to be enjoyed, requiring little preparation on our part.
