_These all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer.... — Acts 1:14_

Without the saints praying together until they touched God’s heart, the stage for the pouring out of the Spirit would not have been set. The principle of steadfast prayer, as seen in the example of the apostles and saints spending ten days together to pray, is a principle we cannot neglect if we also want to have the one accord. This steadfast prayer indicates that those who were praying continued to do so until their spirits and also their souls were one with the Lord and with each other.
