_But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition._  
_– Philippians 2:19_

It was not only Timothy’s report but also his ability to work with Paul that would be such an encouragement to the apostle. Paul was encouraged because Timothy would be able to help the Philippians, for he sincerely cared for their state.
