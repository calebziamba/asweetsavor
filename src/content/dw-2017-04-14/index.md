_Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord._ _– Genesis 13:18_

Later, Abraham moved his tent to Hebron and built another altar there (Gen. 13:18). “Hebron” means “seat of association” (Strong, no. 2275), which implies fellowship. In fact, it is derived from a word whose meaning includes the thought of fellowship (Strong, no. 2266).

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 91.
