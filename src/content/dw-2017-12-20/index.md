_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _— Philippians 2:14–15_

Because my children possess something of me, they testify of me in many ways. The Lord is blameless and pure, and we, as His children, shine as lights in the midst of this crooked and perverse generation. In other words, those in the dark world around us can see us living a marvelous life enjoying God’s full salvation. While others grasp at things and complain about their situations, we are able to see and experience Christ in all things.
