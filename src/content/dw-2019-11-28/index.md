_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son_  
_–_ _Romans_ _1:1-3_

We may sometimes feel that God is abstract or distant from us. However, as the gospel, the Son of God brings the truth, or reality, of God to us. Jesus said, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). God may seem far away from us, One to be worshiped from a distance. However, the Son of God, who is the reality of God, is near to us (Rom. 10:8). We can experience, enjoy, and obtain Him. Truly, the gospel is not only good news, but also “floods of joy” for us to experience and enjoy continually day after day and step after step.

We may think we have fully gained and enjoyed the Lord, but He will say to us, “There is still more!” We may feel that our experiences of the Lord could not be richer, but He will say to us, “There is more to experience!” This is the wonderful, unfathomable gospel.
