_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

The foundation of the second stage is to build up something in us so that we can have the same feeling as the Lord. In the beginning of the second stage, the Lord reveals Himself as One who is coming to us leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills (2:8).

He comes. He has prevailed and overcome all difficulties, all obstacles, and all hardships. Nothing can prevent His coming. He reveals that He is not only a Lord of the chambers, a Lord of enjoyment, and a Lord of love; He is also a Lord who leads us to rise up and overcome everything to live a heavenly, transcendent life. He can lead us to walk above everything in resurrection with Him.
