_Just as I am, without one plea,_  
_but that thy blood was shed for me,_  
_and that thou bidd'st me come to thee,_  
_O Lamb of God, I come, I come._  
_– From a hymn by Charlotte Elliott_

It is all His mercy that we have any revelation or vision. We have nothing to boast of in following the Lord. We come to Him, as the hymn says, “just as I am, without one plea.” We can’t claim credit for anything.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch "Go to the listing for this book"),  
_by Titus Chu, page 133.
