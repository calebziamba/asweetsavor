_That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me._ _â€“ John 17:21_

The Lord prayed for us to be in the triune God, and this has now been accomplished. We know this from Colossians 3:3, which tells us,

_You have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God._

Once we are born again we are in the triune God.
