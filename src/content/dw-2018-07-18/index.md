_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. – Romans 5:10_

In Romans, Paul’s revelation of the triune God does not emphasize the objective aspect of salvation but the subjective and practical aspect of it. He reveals to us how we can experience the triune God for our complete salvation.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 12.
