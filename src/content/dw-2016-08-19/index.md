Even if we have a good personality, it might be destroyed in the church life. Perhaps a young brother gives up everything for the Lord, but then an older one tells him that he should follow So-and-so in order to have a way, or he should do a certain thing that will please this or that leading brother. This kind of advice destroys and ruins the young ones and causes them to leave the way of the Lord.
