_He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering.”_ _– Genesis 22:2_

This is the way God has appointed for us—the way of death. This way leads us to have nothing but God Himself as our portion. We will experience excitement, overcoming, light, and also temptations, weaknesses, and trials. These experiences leave us with nothing but God. May we be like Paul, who said, “I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ” (Phil. 3:8). At this point we will tell the Lord,

> _“Lord, I have no one but You. Even what You promised and the result of Your work on me is in Your hand. I have no one but You. I have lost all the works I have done, all the praise, and all the glory. Even the fulfillment of Your desire in me seems to be gone. I have nothing. Lord, I praise You. Now I know that You are God.”_

We need the Lord’s mercy that we would faithfully follow Him to the place where we have only God as our portion.
