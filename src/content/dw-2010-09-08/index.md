_Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. — John 15:4_ As we become involved with activities, these often take on the preeminence which rightfully belongs to the Lord. The things we might feel are serving our generation for Christ, such as preaching the gospel, leading Bible studies, and so on, can merely be Christian things for us to do. These same activities can also be the means for us to care for what is really in the Lord’s heart. If we preach the gospel and yet remain fruitless, we should ask why. The Bible tells us that if we fail to abide in Christ—if we fail to care for what is on His heart—we “cannot bear fruit” (John 15:4).

There are thousands of believers who love the Lord and are doing many things in His name, yet how many really care for God’s heart? Some young people’s events today involve contemporary music. When older Christians voice concern about this, the young people defend what has been helpful to them. The issue, however, is not what kind of music we are using but doing what pleases the Lord. Regardless how things may appear outwardly, our criteria must be that the Lord Himself is satisfied and His need is met.
