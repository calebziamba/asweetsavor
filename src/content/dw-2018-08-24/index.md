_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

Romans 12 describes the most basic level of transformation—every saint has a spiritual portion, a function, and can fulfill that function. The highest level of transformation is seen in chapter 16, where Paul greets many brothers and sisters by name. His greetings indicate that he had been renewed and transformed and could testify, “Every saint is in my heart. Every saint is a blessing to me, and I am a blessing to every saint.”
