_It came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. – Genesis 15:17 (ASV)_

In our experience, we have evening and morning, evening and morning, furnace and torch, furnace and torch. David had the same experience. After he killed Goliath, the women sang, “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands” (1 Sam. 18:7). Then Saul set David over the men of war, and David became Saul’s son-in-law. How glorious it was! At that time he was in high spirits, for he was in the flaming torch experience. He never imagined that things could change so quickly. Saul became jealous and sought to kill him. He spent years fleeing and hiding from Saul. This was David’s smoking furnace experience.
