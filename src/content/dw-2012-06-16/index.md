_And in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, — Colossians 2:11-13_ The church in Jerusalem initially experienced a wonderful church life. Recall how Peter told the lame one, “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk” (Acts 3:6).

Peter had nothing else to boast in but Christ alone. He couldn’t give the poor, crippled man any material thing, but he could give him Christ. Because Christ was the focus of Peter’s living, there could be such a testimony, and there could be such a healing.
