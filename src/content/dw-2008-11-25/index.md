_Too long has my soul had its dwelling With those who hate peace. I am for peace, but when I speak, They are for war._ _— Psalm 120:6-7_

When we desire to go after God, then the world is for war. If we are not for God, if we are just in the world speaking lies and deceiving each other (v. 2), then no one will care. This will not seem so bad to the world, because we can still gain some prosperity, and we can still be in religion (v. 5). But when we say, “I am for peace,” when we say that we are for the Lord and for what is real on this earth, then the whole world will rise up: “We are for war! If you are not part of us, we will fight against you!”

If a college student declares on his campus, “I am a Christian. I love the Lord!” then all of his friends and classmates will be for war. They will fight against him. This is the world. The world will never tolerate anyone who lives a life solely for God. That is why the psalmist says, “I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.” First the world is a world of lies, but eventually it wars against those who want God. As those who are following the Lord, we all must have such a clear vision.
