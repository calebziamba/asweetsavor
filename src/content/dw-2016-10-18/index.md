_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._ _—Philippians 2:8_

Jesus maintained His lowly position and waited obediently on His Father. Our situation is often the opposite. We may do things in the Lord’s name without waiting for His leading. Unlike us, Christ never behaved in a rash manner because He was continually attentive to the Father. His will was surrendered to His God, and His obedience was unto death. There can be no greater obedience. This is what the Father demanded.
