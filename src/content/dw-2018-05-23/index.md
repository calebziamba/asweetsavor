_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _â€” Romans 1:1-3_

If we read the Bible without Christ, we are not reading in the light. If we speak without Christ, we are not speaking forth revelation. If we visit people without Christ, we are not supplying them with life. If we care for the saints without Christ, we are not caring for them properly. Without Christ, everything becomes false, vain, and valueless. We can learn how to read the Bible, how to speak, how to preach the gospel, and even how to manage the church life, but if in these things we do not have Christ, want Christ, and love Christ, we are to be accursed (1 Cor. 16:22).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 8.
