_“I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.’” — Song of Songs 5:2_

Here is a simple calling of the Lord, “Open to me,…for my head is full of dew, my locks with the damp of night.”

What is portrayed in this scene? This is His experience at Gethsemane. The Lord reminds her of His sufferings in Gethsemane. In that night, His head was full of dew, and His locks were filled with the drops of the night.
