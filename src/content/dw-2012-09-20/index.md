_Your lips are like a scarlet thread, And your mouth is lovely. Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranate Behind your veil. — Song of Songs 4:3_

_Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person._ _— Colossians 4:6_

Here the Lord praises the lips of the one who is seeking Him, saying of her, “Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely.”

The scarlet thread signifies redemption. Her speaking for the Lord is through redemption, not in a careless way. The thread of scarlet also signifies authority. This indicates that her speaking for the Lord is not only through redemption but also with authority.

That her mouth is lovely means that her words are with grace (Col. 4:6). Our words should water others. Furthermore, her words are filtered through the Lord’s dealing. They are not opinion or gossip. Her words are able to meet the need of various listeners on differing occasions. Bringing life and nourishment, her words are sweet and refreshing.
