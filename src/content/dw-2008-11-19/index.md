_I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh._

_— Ezekiel 36:26_

Not only do we have a new heart, but we also have a new spirit. Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, our human spirit was dead. But now we have a new spirit, which is a living spirit. When God first created man, He created him with a human spirit to contact God. But after the fall of man, and after man's continuous degradation, the human spirit within man became deadened. Every human being who has not believed in the Lord Jesus has a dead spirit. But once we are born again, we can say, “My spirit is living!” We have received a new spirit, a spirit filled with life.

Before we were born again, whenever we heard about Jesus we got bothered. Whenever we went to a church service we felt it was too long. Whenever we saw a Bible we wanted to toss it aside. But when we were born again we received a new spirit, and everything changed. All of a sudden we began to enjoy meeting with Christian brothers and sisters. We loved reading the Bible. We loved hearing and talking about Jesus. Because our spirit was made alive, we became so interested in the things related to God. This is the result of being born again.
