_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

Sooner or later, those who are not abiding in the vision of the Lord will give up the church life. It is better for them to go sooner rather than waste their time. If we desire to follow the Lord, we must tell Him, “I must see You afresh. Otherwise I am wasting my time. I want to have Your appearing and abide in it.”
