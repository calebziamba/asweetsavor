_Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. One Body and one Spirit, even as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. — Ephesians 4:3-6

_In Ephesians four we find the seven ones. There are one Body, one Spirit, and one calling (Eph. 4:4). We have one Lord, one faith, and one baptism (Eph. 4:5). Then we have one God, the Father, who is over all and through all and in all (Eph. 4:6).

In the Triune God there is this divine oneness for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose. Our responsibility is to endeavor to keep this oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace (Eph. 4:3). The oneness is already here. Now we simply need to keep it.
