We need a personality that will build up the Body of Christ. The Lord will not abolish our inborn nature, but He will continuously infuse the divine life into us. The divine life will bring in the divine nature. This divine nature helps us exercise our character. Eventually it is possible to have a full-grown personality that can be useful to the Lord.

The better your personality is, the more useful you are to the Lord. Therefore, you must pay attention to your relationship with the Lord and to your life-exercise.
