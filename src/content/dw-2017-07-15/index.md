_He who has the bride is the bridegroom._ _– John 3:29a_

Here, John the Baptist calls himself “the friend of the bridegroom.” As the friend, he rejoiced that Christ, the Bridegroom, was gaining a bride. We, the believers, are this bride. As we are being built up as the body, we are also being prepared to be His bride to marry Him.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 81.
