_But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world._ _– Galatians 6:14_

You shouldn’t have an incorrect concept about transformation. You shouldn’t think that one day you will not know sin anymore and will be just like Christ. No. No matter how experienced you become, the world won’t be crucified to you. This is the reason Paul said, “But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world” (Gal. 6:14). It is a fact that the world has been crucified. But it is only when you yourself are crucified that the world is crucified to you.hers.
