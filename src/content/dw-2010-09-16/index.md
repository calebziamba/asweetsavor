I am afraid that very few among us live as priests before God. Only a few gather to pray at the designated times of prayer or have a time of personal prayer. Therefore, most flunk the first matter necessary for a healthy church life. Furthermore, few are willing to shepherd others. Therefore, most also flunk the second requirement, that of being shepherds and leaders. Finally, I am afraid that most also fail to speak for the Lord. Yet if any local church is short in any of these three categories, the Lord will not be able to operate to the extent He desires.
