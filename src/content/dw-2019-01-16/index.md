_“Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham.”_  
_– Genesis 26:18_

We should not dream that one day when we pray, the Spirit will be poured out on us, and we will be glorious forever. There is no such thing in this life. Young believers may enjoy the flow of life long after they have been saved. Even so, they must learn to dig. Though the water is constantly flowing in our spirit, sometimes we don’t sense it. When this happens, we must dig to get rid of the mud within us. We must dig out whatever hinders our experience of the Spirit’s flow.
