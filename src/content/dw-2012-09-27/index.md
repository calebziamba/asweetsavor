_Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. — Song of Songs 4:4, KJV_

In the Bible, the neck refers to man’s will; the first thing Satan attacks is our neck. No matter whether it is through sin, the evil world, or the “good” world, Satan succeeds if we leave our place of submission under the Lord’s authority.
