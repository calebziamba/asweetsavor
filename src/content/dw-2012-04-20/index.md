As you labor in your field, practice to have fresh experiences of Christ. Also, it is better not to labor by yourself, but together with a few others. Invest yourself in others and allow others to invest themselves in you. None of us should be isolated, selfish, or lonely as we labor in our field. We should invest ourselves in one another as we serve together in the church life.
