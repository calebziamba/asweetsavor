By God’s mercy I am a servant of the Lord, though perhaps not so useful to the Lord; I still limit the Lord in many ways. However, I don’t want to live in falsehood. I love the brothers, I love the  churches, I love the Word of the Lord, and I follow the Lord seriously. This is because I have met the Lord, touched the Lord, consecrated myself to the Lord, and lived for the Lord soberly. As a result, the divine nature is constituted into me. This is not through human teaching, but the result of divine constitution.
