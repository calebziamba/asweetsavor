_Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship._ _– Romans 12:1_

What is the significance of consecration? Before we gave ourselves to God, we had our own rights. From the time we declared our consecration to God, however, we surrendered those rights to Him. Before our consecration, we were our own boss, but after our consecration, God became our boss. Our position changed. In one sense, God has always been our boss, just as the potter has right over the clay (Rom. 9:21). However, our consecration is a declaration by faith that we are willing to cooperate with God.

We don’t need to be afraid if we feel we cannot consecrate ourselves. If we say, “I want to consecrate but I cannot,” it shows the Potter is working on the clay. We should simply go to the Lord and tell Him we are weak. If we are struggling with our consecration, it shows that God has been working on us for some time. We have to stand on the position of consecration and present ourselves to God.
