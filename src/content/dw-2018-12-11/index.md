If we lose our temper, we should immediately go to the Lord rather than dwell on it. If we are ashamed of ourselves, we should return to the Lord as soon as possible. We shouldn’t waste our time feeling sorry for ourselves since our Lord is so rich. Those who pity themselves and enjoy the feeling of weakness will have a weak conscience and open the door to Satan’s accusations. When we fail, we should simply claim the cleansing blood of the Lord and tell Him, “Lord, I come to You.”
