_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

_There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him. — Revelation 22:3_

In writing to the Philippians, Paul addressed them as “the saints in Christ Jesus,” but he spoke of himself as a bond-servant of Christ Jesus (1:1). We are first saints in Christ Jesus, but by enjoying His holiness, we eventually become slaves of Christ Jesus.

The destiny of every saint is to become the Lord’s bond-servant (Rev. 22:3). Once we are slaves of Christ Jesus, we have no right to decide our future or manage our own living. Eventually our experience will become like that of the apostle Paul.
