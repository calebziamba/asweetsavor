_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

Today God’s tabernacle is the church life. To be consumed for God’s house is to be consumed for the church life. But do we have this desperation? We are here in the church life, but where is the substance of the church life? We have heard so much, we understand so much, and we can declare so much, but where is the reality?

When we realize how short we are we will become desperate and cry out, “Until the reality comes, I will have no rest! I will not give sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids! I will struggle! I will fight to bring in the substance of the Lord’s testimony!” This is the sign of true maturity.

When we enter into the maturity that is depicted in this psalm we can no longer be satisfied with merely being a blessing to the church. Instead we strive for the entire church life to come into reality. This causes us to cry out, “Lord, I will not give myself any rest! I will not close my eyes until You gain Your habitation!”
