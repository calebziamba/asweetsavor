_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?”_

_“My beloved extended his hand through the opening,_ _And my feelings were aroused for him.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:3-4_

It may take a long time for us to experience the Lord’s call, and finally to answer His call. Perhaps the Lord has asked us several times to open to Him , but we have not been able to respond. Deep within us, we know the Lord has a request for us. We know He is asking us to carry the cross. We just cannot understand the reason.

The Lord says, “Open to Me,” but we think, “How can I open the door? Things couldn’t be better than they are now. And aren’t these all from the Lord and for the Lord? Why would I jeopardize this?”

We go through a long period of struggle, although the Lord exposes His nail-marked hand and shows us that He is still on the outside, with His head full of dew and His locks wet with the drops of night. We remain inside, even though the Lord is in another realm. We simply cannot answer His call.
