_But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God; which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words. â€” First Corinthians 2:12-13_ Only the person who knows the Spirit and who is spiritual can dispense the economy of God to others. If you are not spiritual, you cannot dispense God in His economy to others, regardless of how eloquent you may be. By means of your natural ability you may be able to preach the gospel and to help others to love the Lord and to read the Bible or come to meetings, but you will not be able to bring them into the economy of God. Only a spiritual person can transfuse others with God in His economy.

In other words, if you desire to minister and to know spiritual things, you must become a spiritual person. If you do not know spiritual things, you cannot minister spiritual things. To the person who is spiritual, however, the things that are spiritual are alive, fresh, and vibrant.
