> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
> 
> – Philippians 4:7 (ESV)

Many Christians do not pray. Instead, they just do what they think needs to be done and never check with the Lord. They may seem to be successful in what they do, but they do not gain Christ in the process. We have to pray and allow Christ to govern everything, from our haircut to our manner of life and our labor. We must let Him know what bothers us and what we desire. We should talk to Him about everything.
