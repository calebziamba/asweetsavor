_I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?_ _– 2 Corinthians 12:15_

We must have a very clear vision that drives us. Others should be able to see that we are giving our whole person and life to carry out our vision. If we are driven by a clear vision, we will desire to see the Lord accomplish His work and see others receive the greatest benefit. Like Paul, we will live and die for those around us (2 Cor. 12:15). Our use of time and our manner of life will always have them in view. If others oppose what we are doing, we will not be deterred, for our vision will drive us. In order to be approved, our living and person should match our clear vision.
