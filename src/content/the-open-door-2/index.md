So the door is opened. Do you know how much happened in these 2,000 years? Millions and millions of people have received the Lord and have God abiding in them. Millions and millions of people began to realize I am one with God, I am united with God. And more than that, millions of people out of millions and millions can say I operated with God in His vitality, His nature is mine. And eventually some real mature ones, all the fathers and all the spiritual men in these 20 centuries were incorporated with God. How marvelous this is, praise the Lord.
