_"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’" Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me." — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

Now she was so troubled that she tried every way to find Him, but it was still in vain. Would she lose the Lord’s presence forever? No. Although our Lord is fearful, He is also lovely. He will not break the bruised reed, nor will He quench the smoking flax (Matt. 12:20).

When she had no way out, the Lord recovered her. The Lord helped her through other brothers and sisters. He helped her through the saints who had the same heart that He did, the saints who were fully united with His will.
