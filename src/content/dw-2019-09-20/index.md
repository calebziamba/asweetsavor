_Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob - Genesis 25:26_

Jacob was still for self as he traveled back home after leaving Laban. He had schemed and worked so hard to accumulate flocks, but in the end he realized that it was God’s doing and God’s blessing on him (Gen. 31:9, 12). Yet when he heard that Esau was coming with four hundred men, he began scheming again to preserve himself, his family, and his possessions instead of relying on God to protect him. He divided his family into groups (32:7), sent presents to appease Esau (vv. 13–15), and bowed down to the ground seven times until he came near his brother (33:3).
