_“As an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste." — Song of Songs 2:3_ Her beloved is “as the apple tree among the trees of the wood.” In the original language “apple” is a kind of fruit that comes from an evergreen plant. This indicates that the Lord’s life is unlimited and can never fail.

Our Lord is “ever green.” His life is unlimited. This life will increase in us. Not only has He brought us into His chambers, not only is our couch green, not only are we in the house; now we are also among the trees of the wood experiencing joy. We are enjoying this unlimited life. The seeker testifies, “How rich the life of my Lord is! How excellent He is! He is like the fruit of the evergreen among the trees of the wood.”
