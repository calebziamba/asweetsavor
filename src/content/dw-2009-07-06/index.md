_God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth. — John 4:24._

What does it mean to worship God? It means to have a deep, personal, and intimate contact with Him. We often misunderstand the true meaning of worship. We may think to worship God means that, since God is so high and we are so low, we must bow down and “worship” God. We think that God, who is the object of our worship, has nothing to do with us. But Jesus told us that God is Spirit, and we must worship Him in spirit. The end result of such a worship is that the two spirits—God the Spirit and our human spirit—become one.

Genuine worship brings the Spirit and our human spirit together. When you worship God, who is Spirit, He is mingled with your spirit. You and God then become one. When we worship God, it does not mean that we are far from Him. It means that we become one with Him. We contact Him, we experience Him, and we enjoy Him. When we worship God in spirit, it means that we enjoy all the riches of Christ. It means that the Spirit of reality operates within our spirit to unveil Christ to us for our subjective enjoyment.
