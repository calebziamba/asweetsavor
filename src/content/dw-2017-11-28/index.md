_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

So many believers cannot grow well spiritually because they are under the influence of this generation, which causes them to become crooked and perverse. They are unable to live as children of God above reproach, for they themselves have been caught in the means used by Satan to bend and turn aside the people of this generation.
