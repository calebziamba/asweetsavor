_For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? In the same way, the things of God also no one has known except the Spirit of God. â€” First Corinthians 2:11_

When you learn to understand things spiritually, and to react to things spiritually, you will become someone who is keen to the things of the Spirit; you will become a person with spiritual awareness.
