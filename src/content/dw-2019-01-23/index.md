_So \[Isaac\] built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.  
__– Genesis 26:25_

Living such an unsettled life, a life of the altar and the tent is certainly hard. Not knowing when the Lord may lead us elsewhere is difficult. However, if we are living a life of the altar and tent, when the Lord leads us to move, we will be able to follow.  
  
We should be very simple before the Lord, living only for Him, allowing Him to work on us so that our portion may benefit the church, regardless where He sends us. If the Lord sends us and the church is benefited, whether we receive glory or dishonor, good report or evil report should make no difference to us (2 Cor. 6:8).
