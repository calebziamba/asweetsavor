> But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power.
> 
> \- Acts 2:24

The third great miracle is the resurrection of Jesus. The birth of Jesus brings God to men, while the resurrection of Jesus brings men to God. With one person he said,“I am God, I am the Word, I am the operating God. I became flesh, I would like to be a man, I would like to be with men, I would like to live among men, and I would like to be with them and fully partake of all their experiences. I will be put on the cross, will die, be buried, and will be in resurrection. Men will become God. I bring in the birth of Jesus so that divinity comes into humanity. In resurrection, humanity is brought into divinity.”
