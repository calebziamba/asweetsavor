_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

The basic offering here was not of Paul; it was of the Philippians. Through Paul’s ministry, they came to know and experience Christ as the One who had saved them from God’s judicial judgment (the trespass offering), who was saving them within from their rebellious sin nature (the sin offering), who was producing the true harmony between them and God (the peace offering), who was absolute for the carrying out of God’s purpose (the burnt offering), and who possessed the humanity that God desires (the meal offering).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 135.
