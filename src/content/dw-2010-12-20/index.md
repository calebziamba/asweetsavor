_“Your eyes are like doves.” — Song of Songs 1:15b_

If you are spiritually “nearsighted,” God will not be able to speak clearly to you, nor can He appear to you. For example, when Eli was old, his eyes were dim, so there was no vision of the Lord through his service (1 Sam. 3:1). If you are not willing to pay the price for the Lord, you will not have spiritual insight. Once you make your own plans, consider your own benefit, or want to gain something for yourself, you lose your spiritual insight. This is a principle. If you serve without spiritual insight, it means you consider what is in your own best interest.

We do not become pure immediately after believing in the Lord. This is why we can see religion and politics being practiced even among us in the church. How can we be preserved from impurity? The Lord says, “Only when your eyes are like doves can you be pure. Only when you have spiritual insight can you stand before Me.”
