_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

Once religious ideology takes over, there is no longer any freedom. Instead, something in addition to the common faith, such as a certain practice or teaching, becomes a measuring stick for fellowship. This prevents people from pursuing Christ.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 179.
