_We are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing. — Second Corinthians 2:15_

_I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ. — Philippians 3:8_

Often we meet people who are occupied with something, and when they have the opportunity to talk about it, they will do so to the point of tedium. Perhaps a person likes to talk about how to make money. That smells funny, quite unpleasent.

Those who desire to talk about Christ, however, have a totally different fragrance. If someone speaks about how he has enjoyed Christ, pursued Christ, and gained Christ, that is fragrant and sweet. I am afraid that many of us in the churches do not magnify Christ in this way, but instead dwell upon things that rob and cheat us of this fragrance. What should characterize us in the churches is that we are pursuers of Christ.
