_Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the fields of Jaar. Let us go into His tabernacle; Let us worship at His footstool. Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, And let Your saints shout for joy. — Psalm 132:6-9_

The Old Testament example of the ark being separated from the tabernacle (cf. 1 Sam. 4) corresponds to how we often feel about the church life.

Isn’t this our situation today? Concerning many churches we would have the realization, “Everything about our setting is right, but where is the substance?” Psalm 132 shows us that the substance of God’s tabernacle is the ark of testimony. Without the ark, the tabernacle is empty. It contains a void. It becomes short of reality.
