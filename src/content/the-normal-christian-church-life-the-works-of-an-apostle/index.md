## Chapter Three: The Elders Appointed by the Apostles

In this chapter, Watchman Nee considers what he calls “one of the most important parts of an apostle’s work,” that is, the appointment of elders.

New Testament elders are appointed for the carrying on of the Lord’s work locally, as opposed to the apostles who are always moving to different places. To put it simply: apostles go, elders stay. They should be comparatively (not absolutely!) mature and already caring for the other saints’ progress on a local level. The term “elder” relates to their _person_ in comparison to others, while their _office_ is “bishop” or “overseer.” In this capacity, their aim should be (1) leading by example, (2) teaching and preaching if they are so gifted (1 Tim. 5:17) (3) shepherding their fellow believers.

All local matters, both temporal and spiritual, are in the elders’ hands. Once elders have been appointed, apostles can exert spiritual authority, exhort, and instruct on doctrinal and moral matters, but they have no legal or official role in the handling of local matters. Elders could even “legally” refuse apostles entry into the church, though this would be wrong spiritually. Though elders are appointed by apostles, the two groups are independent of each other.

## Chapter Four: The Churches Founded by the Apostles

Chapter four begins to challenge practical realities. In it, Watchman Nee considers what, scripturally, divides the universal, invisible church into local, visible churches. The only answer he finds in Scripture is: the city limits_._ However, he does break this down further into whatever is the smallest unit of local administration, whether borough or postal code. He argues that anything smaller is a sect, and that anything larger is unbiblical.

Among churches organized by their cities, individual responsibility to Christ must be maintained alongside an inward spiritual relatedness. It is a balancing act in which each local church is respected as the highest authority in their locality, but they seek to learn from and keep pace with one another. What a requirement of wisdom and Spirit on elders and apostles! Such an arrangement requires apostles to stay out of official capacity and for the sphere of locality to have a center of nothing but Christ. Watchman Nee examines benefits to this kind of administration, namely, the ability to limit persuasive false prophets, heresy, and sects or denominationalism. Some may argue that the outward expression of the church is based on the inward content, therefore, we should only worry about the content. Watchman Nee says that If the inward content of the church is wrong, the Spirit of God must deal with it; but ultimately, the goal is _both_ an outward expression and an inward condition that pleases God.
