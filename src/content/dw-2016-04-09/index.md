_Then Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. The Lord smelled the soothing aroma; and the Lord said to Himself, “I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the intent of man’s heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done._

_“While the earth remains,_ _Seedtime and harvest,_ _And cold and heat,_ _And summer and winter,_ _And day and night_ _Shall not cease.”_
