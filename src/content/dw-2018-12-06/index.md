_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

The first significant point about Isaac is that he was the center of God’s plan. Regarding Isaac, God told Abraham, “I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant” (Gen. 17:19). God’s plan was to bless all the nations of the earth through Abraham’s seed, that is, through Isaac (22:18). God would do nothing apart from Isaac, Abraham’s seed and heir.

We also, as sons of Abraham (Gal. 3:7) and heirs according to promise (v. 29), are now the center of God’s plan. God may do many things, but we are His focus.
