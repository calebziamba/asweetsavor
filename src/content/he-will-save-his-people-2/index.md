> _"And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”_
> 
> \- Matthew 1:21

Here, the angel says, "He will save His people," that includes you and me, "from their sins." Are we gamblers? No. Alcoholics? No. Very corrupt? No. Very sinful? Yes! Why? Because in the past, before we were saved, we denied God. That was our sin. One day, we were saved, but be careful, we still need to be saved. There are many things we do, and God would say, "I am not a part of it."
