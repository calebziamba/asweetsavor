In our new position, we have peace toward God. Romans 5:1 says,

_Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ._

The fact that we have peace toward God means that we shouldn’t be bothered by our personal condition anymore. We shouldn’t say, “I’m so poor. I’m so defeated. I have so many failures.” The Bible makes it clear that we have peace toward God already. God doesn’t remember those things, so why should we bother to remember them? Why should we look at our failures? God says, “I don’t see them,” and we should say, “I don’t see them either.” Our Christian life should not be one that is under condemnation, but rather, one of peace and rest.  Now that we are born again, we have peace toward God. Praise Him!
