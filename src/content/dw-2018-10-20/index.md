Living unto the Lord goes beyond just living for the Lord. It means that Christ Himself is our goal, the center and focus of everything we do. Every day Christ needs to be our aim. Let us live unto Christ!

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 146.
