One key to our being approved is our ability to receive everything as from the Lord’s hand. Often events and circumstances do not seem fair and have no logical explanation, yet they are according to the Lord’s sovereignty.We must submit to the Lord in all the situations He has arranged for us if we wish to serve Him. To be approved, we must be able to discover and experience Christ in the circumstances God arranges for us.
