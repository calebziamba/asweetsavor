_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste. He brought me into the banqueting house,_ _And his banner over me was love. Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, For I am sick with love.__”_ _— Song of Songs 2:3-5_

In her happiness of resting in His love, the Lord’s seeker says, “Oh, Lord. How good is the banqueting house. How good are the fruits of the evergreen. How good it is to sit in Your shade. However, I am too happy to go on. I don’t have the capacity to contain this love. I need You to support me.”

Now the seeker knows she needs the help of others. Therefore she says, “Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples.”
