Many things may be very good and even spiritual, but they are not the Lord Himself. They will not take us through the real testing when it comes. We can only be approved when our stand is unto the Lord alone.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 145.
