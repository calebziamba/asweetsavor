_“I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”_ _– Genesis. 15:1, NKJV._

Both the shield and the reward are, in reality, God Himself. Those who have small “shields” are vulnerable to the flaming arrows of the evil one (Eph. 6:16). If anything touches their minds, they will be easily beguiled (2 Cor. 11:3). If anything touches their emotions, they will be too sad to get up. Because their shield is so small, there are many unprotected places. We must gain Christ as our portion so that our shield can be enlarged.
