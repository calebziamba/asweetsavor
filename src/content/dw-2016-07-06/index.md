The freedom we have in Christ includes being freed from Satan’s authority and brought into the kingdom of God (Col. 1:13). How does God accomplish this transfer? He does it by making us alive. Ephesians 2:4–5 says,

_God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)._

From all of these points, we can see that we have been set free from five negative things: sin, death, the world, the flesh, and the authority of Satan.
