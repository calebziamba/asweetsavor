Ever since the apostle Paul wrote his epistle to the believers in Rome, it has served as a starting point for millions of Christians who desire to understand God’s full plan of salvation, a plan expressed in the phrase “the gospel of God.” Yet despite Paul’s marvelous statement in the first chapter that this gospel is “the power of God for salvation,” many struggle to understand the gospel, to see it as relevant in their own life, and to daily experience such saving power.

In this three-volume commentary, Titus Chu walks us verse by verse through Romans with the goal of bringing us into a vibrant relationship with Jesus Christ, who is the gospel Himself, and with other believers in a local church life. Throughout his commentary, he examines how our interactions with the gospel powerfully affect and transform us according to the will of God.
