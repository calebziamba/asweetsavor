_Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers...And the fourth river is the Euphrates. — Genesis 2:10,14b_

_He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. — John 7:38_

_For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. — 2 Corinthians 2:15_

Now we come to the fourth branch of this unique river. This fourth branch of the river is the Euphrates, which means “fragrant, sweet” (Genesis 2:10,14b) . It is the last of the four branches, which means it is the culmination of the other three. When a person is experiencing the flow of the divine stream, he ultimately manifests something fragrant and sweet. This fragrance, this sweetness, is manifested in his living, in his pursuing, and in his operation.

Firstly, a person who is enjoying the divine flow will manifest a kind of sweetness in his living. Those who serve the Lord, for instance, should give evidence of this in their homes. It should be seen in how the saints live in their families and in their dwellings.

Secondly, whether or not a person is enjoying the divine flow will be seen in that person's pursuing. Any pursuing that leads away from the Lord is wrong as far as the divine flow is concerned. If a brother pursues a high-paying job, for example, the sweetness and the fragrance that characterizes the divine flow is not seen with him, for such a pursuing is not according to God and His economy. If, however, that brother is offered a high-paying job and says, “I don't care about this job, because I am for Christ and the church!” then his pursuing is proper, and it is something of sweetness.
