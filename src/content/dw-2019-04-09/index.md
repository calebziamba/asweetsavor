_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

The Song of Songs is a book that reveals all the experiences we must go through in our Christian life. It is impossible for us as believers in Christ to avoid the experiences revealed in its eight chapters. No matter how deep, how excellent, or how rich our experiences are, they all can be found here.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 11.
