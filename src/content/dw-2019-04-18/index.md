_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1  
_

_Until the day breaks_

_And the shadows flee away,_

_I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh_

_And to the hill of frankincense._ 

_– Song of Songs 4:6_

If we know the Song of Songs, we will understand when “the day dawns” and “the shadows flee away,” and we will be able to thank and praise the Lord rather than be bewildered or stumbled. We will be able to tell the Lord, “Thank You for this time and this situation. It has not been in vain, and neither have my tears been shed in vain.”
