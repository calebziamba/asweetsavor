_“Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:8_

As the Lord calls us forward to be with Him in His ascension, He first helps us to know our position. Where are we? We are in Lebanon; we are on the ground of ascension. We don’t need to ask for victory; we are on the ground of victory. We don’t need to ask for strength; we are on the ground of strength. We don’t need to ask for light; we are in the light. Why? Because we are with the Lord in the heavenly places.

According to our position and status, we are the people of heaven, though we still walk on the earth. May the Lord open our eyes to see that our position is in the heavenlies!
