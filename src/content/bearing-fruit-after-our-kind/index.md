The three kinds of plant life which God creates on the dry land during the third day of Creation represent three stages of growth which a believer experiences after they begin to testify of Christ (i.e. the dry land appears). First is [the grass](https://www.asweetsavor.org/sharing-the-gospel-in-the-principle-of-grass/), which spreads by its roots and represents the spread of the gospel in a Christian’s life as a result of Christ’s living radiating out from them. Second is [the herb,](https://www.asweetsavor.org/becoming-an-herb-yielding-seeds/) which yields seeds (other Christians) capable of bringing the good news of Christ with them wherever _they_ go. Today, we will discuss the highest form of plant life created on the third day: the fruit-bearing tree.

> Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth”; and it was so.
> 
> \- Gen 1:11 NKJV

Unlike the grass and the herb, who focus on spreading, the fruit-bearing tree includes the statement “after its kind.” This reveals a further purpose than simply spreading or multiplying. It introduces the matter of reproduction. Fruit trees, which are the culmination of the third day’s Created things, are all unique from one another. Yet each fruit is “according to its kind” and the fruit’s seed is “in itself” (Gen 1:11). In other words, when a tree produces fruit, that fruit contains the seed which will become a new fruit tree of the same nature as its parent—that is, it will look and bear fruit just like the tree which first bore it.

So, what do fruit trees have to do with us? Well, Jesus and the New Testament writers speak a lot about people as being able to “bear fruit.” Here are just a few instances:

> I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.
> 
> \- John 15:5 NASB

> By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
> 
> \- John 15:8 NASB

> “Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits."
> 
> \- Matt. 7:15-16a NASB

> I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
> 
> \- Rom. 1:13 NASB

> so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please _Him_ in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God
> 
> \- Col 1:10 NASB

In other words, the result of our works is called our fruit. Just as there are many kinds of fruit trees, there are also many kinds of Christians producing many kinds of fruits according to who they are. Every Christian can bear fruit based on the gifts which the Lord has graciously given to each one.

> For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, _each of us is to exercise them accordingly_: if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith; if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching; or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
> 
> \- Rom. 12:4-8 NASB

> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another _various_ kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.
> 
> \- 1 Cor 12:7-11 NASB

The Spirit of God has given to each believer a measure of grace which is manifested as a gift. From this grace we bear fruit through the exercising of these gifts. As seen in both Romans and 1 Corinthians, these gifts can vary widely from person to person. One person may be gifted in serving fellow believers, while another may be a gifted evangelist. When the gifted servant sees the comfort and love which the believers experience, that is his fruit. When the gifted evangelist helps a lost soul find the Lord’s grace, that is his fruit. The variety of gifts is like that of fruit trees themselves. Although there are many different kinds, they can each bear fruit. _All_ believers have a function in the body of Christ, and should strive to produce fruit according to that function.

> Not only can everyone beget, including those who are just saved, but all the brothers can eventually function in the principle of “after its kind.”

Yet the fruit is not all that is produced! According to God’s speaking at the creation of fruit trees, there should be a seed or core within the fruit. This seed contains the life to (re)produce the parent tree. Our fruit is not simply for our own enjoyment, but the fruit should result in seeds—that is, other believers—who are able to grow into strong fruit trees themselves, each according to their kind.

> This must be a large seed, even as a “core.” This does not merely stress the spreading; rather, it stresses the reproduction. A healthy fruit tree should not only have fruit in view, but should even have cores in view. This is why Paul said in Ephesians 4 that God has given “some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying (or, building up) of the body of Christ” (vv. 11–12). The richest fruit trees, such as apostles or evangelists, should have a strong core to reproduce apostles or evangelists, or, at least people who do the work of an apostle and the work of an evangelist.
