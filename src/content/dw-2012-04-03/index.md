_David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down to him. And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. — 1 Samuel 22:1-2_ How was David able to take the group of hapless people God sent to him and form them into an army able to deliver the city of Keilah from the attacking Philistines? The number of people who first came to David was four hundred, but by the time he rescued Keilah, that number had grown to six hundred (1 Sam. 22:2; 23:13).

This group became the nucleus of a prevailing army which fought alongside David for the establishment of his kingdom. Thirty-seven from among them became famous as David’s mighty men (2 Sam. 23:8–39). If you love the Lord, aspire to become such a “mighty man” in God’s spiritual army. We are all qualified.
