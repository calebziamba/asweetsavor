_“__So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah!  
And he said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me?  
Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then  
have you deceived me?"”  
– Genesis 32:28  
_

If we think we are strong, God will have someone just as strong to be with us. If we think we are smart, God will arrange someone just as smart to be with us. God arranges everyone and everything just for us. He will give us a good companion in order to mold the Jacob in us into Israel. If we prefer this way, our companion will prefer that way. It has nothing to do with right or wrong. It has everything to do with us. If we want to preach the gospel, our companion will want to read the Bible together. We can never agree. Such companions make each other suffer. This is God’s wonderful arrangement!
