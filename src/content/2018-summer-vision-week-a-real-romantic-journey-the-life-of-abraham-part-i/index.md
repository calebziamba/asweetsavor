If there is one unique person that is the most attractive and colorful, who lived a life in valleys and on mountain tops, among thorns and in green pastures, it is Abraham (and in succession, Isaac, and Jacob). Their lives denote a journey of following the Lord in faith (God the Father), of inheriting all the spiritual riches (God the Son), and of the transforming work (God the Spirit). Our experiences of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are a base or core of all that will come in our Christian life. When we are serious with the Lord, He will give us a “romantic life” following Him–that is, a life of “surprise with affection, with love, even with the operation of love.”

During this 1-week training, brother Titus Chu ministers on the early stages of the romantic life Abraham experienced in his walk with God. Beginning with God's appearing to Abraham and calling him out from Ur of the Chaldeans, through his arrival in the land of Canaan until his settling between Bethel and Ai, these early stages of his journey are filled with rich significance as they relate to every Christian's own romantic journey with the Lord.
