_Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, so that they bore children._ _– Genesis 20:17_

God had completely shut up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, and Abraham prayed for them so that they bore children (20:17–18). He overcame his weakness and prayed for others. In fact, Abraham overcame to the point that he even went beyond his own experience. He was childless, yet he was able to pray for others to have children. Those who are young in the Lord can only give others what they have experienced. However, Abraham was able to bless Abimelech with something beyond his experience. Those who are blameless can overcome their own weaknesses and bless others with something they don’t have.
