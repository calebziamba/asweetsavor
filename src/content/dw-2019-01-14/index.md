_“Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham.”_  
_– Genesis 26:18_

Digging again the wells signifies our continual need to deal with our flesh and natural life. Wells must be dug again and again to get rid of the mud. The problem is not with the spring—the Lord is always flowing (Psa. 36:9). It is our flesh and natural life that has to be dealt with so that Christ may flow in our spirit. The more we dig, the more Christ flows in us.
