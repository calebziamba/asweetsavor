_“You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself.” — Exodus 19:4

But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved) and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. — Ephesians 2:4-6_ God did not require the children of Israel to overcome the handicaps and obstacles which seemed to block their exodus from Egypt. He simply put them on His back and flew! Likewise, we today are in the heavenlies with Christ not due to our own efforts but because God raised us up (Eph. 2:6).

We did not climb up to this high peak; God bore us on eagles’ wings. God brought us out of where we were and placed us in the heavenly realm so that our focus and enjoyment might be nothing other than Christ Himself. He did not bring us to this point to bless our talent or so that our service to Him might be successful. His purpose in bringing us to the heavenly realm was to bring us to Himself.
