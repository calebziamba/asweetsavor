_If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? — Psalm 130:3_ If the Lord were to write down a list of our sins, how long would it be? It would fill up volumes. If we were to read even one page, we couldn’t handle it. We would say, “I am so evil! I am so sinful! I am so far from the Lord! I am so rebellious, and so unwilling to submit! Oh Lord, this is who I am!”

For this reason we no longer have any trust in ourselves. We realize that we are utterly dependent on the Lord’s mercy. It is when we are under the Lord’s shining to this degree that we become qualified to build the church.
