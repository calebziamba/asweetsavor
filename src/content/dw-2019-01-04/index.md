_“I am the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you, and multiply your descendants, for the sake of My servant Abraham.” So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well._ _– Genesis 26:23–25_

We should be able to say, “I am in God’s hand. I am blessed. God will never leave me.” No matter how much we plan and work toward our own goals, God will have His way.
