_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus.  
– Philippians 1:1  
  
But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
– Philippians 2:22  
  
_When we are shepherding younger believers or sharing the gospel with our friends, we should do it in a way that wins their hearts.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 163.
