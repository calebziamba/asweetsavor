When I was first saved, I was asked to fill out a questionnaire to determine my understanding of the Christian faith. I was happy to answer questions such as, “Do you believe in Jesus?” “Is Jesus God?” “Is the Bible the Word of God?” and so on. It seemed that all the questions should be answered with a “yes.” When I arrived at the question, “Will you sin again?” I thought, “The preacher said no more sin,” so I wrote, “No.”

We are funny people. Either we proclaim we are able to follow the Lord victoriously when, in fact, we cannot, or we despise ourselves and seek refuge in a worldly life.
