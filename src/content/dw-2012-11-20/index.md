Becoming king of Israel did not make things easier for David than they were when Saul was persecuting him. He reigned for forty years, first in Hebron for seven and a half years, and then in Jerusalem for thirty-three years (2 Sam. 5:5). During these forty years, he was still maturing. He had achieved a certain stature as king, but as he ruled, he continued to mature.

In this life, we should never consider that we have arrived at the fullness of God’s desire for us. Even when we seem to be mature, we still need to mature further (Phil. 3:12–14). When we grow to a point that we have a ministry, the carrying out of that ministry causes us to grow more. When Paul was sent out from Antioch (Acts 13:1–3), he was already relatively mature, but as he journeyed and labored to raise up churches and believers, he matured further. We should consider David’s kingship not primarily as a time of having arrived but as a time during which he continued to mature.
