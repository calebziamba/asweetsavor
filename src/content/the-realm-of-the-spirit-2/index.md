The Spirit surrounds us in this realm. He preserves us, blesses us, and guides us. The Spirit is both inside and outside of us. The Spirit supplies us, leads us, and can be our enjoyment and experience.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-romans),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 39
