> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, all who are mature, let’s have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that to you as well;

Those who are perfect have the desire to “press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus” (v. 14). Therefore, they “have this attitude” that considers everything with this goal in view. They aim at the best and the highest. They can boldly declare, “My living on this earth is for one thing: to gain Christ!”
