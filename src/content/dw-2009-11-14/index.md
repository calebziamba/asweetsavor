_But the spiritual man discerns all things, but he himself is discerned by no one. For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ. â€” First Corinthians 2:15-16_ If you are spiritually sensitive, when you read the Bible, you will discover truth. If you are spiritually keen, you will react spiritually in all situations. If you are someone who has developed a high degree of spiritual awareness, your spiritual riches will come forth readily as you fellowship with others, and in a manner befitting the need. If you are equipped in this way, you will know how to help others according to their real need, for you will be spiritually sensitive to their situation.
