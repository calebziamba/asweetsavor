_“Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name.”_ _– Genesis 11:4_

_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you...._ _And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”_ _– Genesis 12:1-3b_

God remembered His covenant with Noah and didn’t destroy the earth when men rebelled by building the Tower of Babel. Instead, He punished them by confounding their language so that they couldn’t communicate (Gen. 11:7–8). This stopped their work and scattered them. Then He called out Abraham, through whom all the nations under God’s judgment would be blessed (12:3).
