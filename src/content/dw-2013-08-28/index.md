_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?”_

_“My beloved extended his hand through the opening,_ _And my feelings were aroused for him.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:3-4_

Since we are in uncertainty regarding the Lord’s call for us to rise up after Him, He places His hand into the opening of the door, which symbolizes our heart. This shows that, because we love Him, there is a certain place within us that is easily touched by the Lord.

The Lord seems to say, “Look at My hand. I went to the cross and shed My blood for you. Look at My hand. You should know My visage and form became marred for you (Isa. 52:14). Now you are in bliss, and it is because of My labor. The glory you enjoy is the result of My suffering. When I was on the earth, I didn’t have these blissful, glorious experiences. My experience was one of loneliness and like a root out of dry ground (Isa. 53:2-3). I was reproached, scourged, and nailed to the cross. I display to you My hand to show you that I am the Lord of suffering.”
