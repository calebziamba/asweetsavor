_Now you are Christ’s body, and individually members of it._ _– 1 Corinthians 12:27_

The life that we received when we were born again demands that we have a corporate living. We can no longer be individualistic, for when we were born again we were born into the body of Christ.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 97.
