_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

We do not always feel the need for salvation, for we think we are competent. Everyone’s self-life is capable in some area. If we are good in music, we may not seek to experience the Lord’s salvation as we sing or play an instrument. If we are good with young people, we may not seek to know the Lord’s salvation as we are with them. We must experience salvation in everything.
