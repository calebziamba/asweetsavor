_"The king has brought me into his chambers." — Song of Songs 1:4b_

_“Our couch is green.” — Song of Songs 1:16b_

_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste." — Song of Songs 2:3_ This life that covers you also becomes your food (2:3b). If a person has the experience of lying on the couch and sitting in the shade of life, he will not be bothered by his defects. If you cannot pray after losing your temper, it shows that you are still in the chambers; you haven’t advanced.
