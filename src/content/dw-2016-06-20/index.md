Before we were born again, we had no hope, and were without God. Ephesians 2:12 speaks of this fact:

_Remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world._

However, Romans 8:24 (Darby) tells us that we were “saved in hope.” In addition, 1 Peter 1:3 says,

_Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead._

According to this verse, we are “born again to a living hope.”
