_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _— Philippians 1:2_

When we as believers come together, countless problems and difficulties come with us. Outside of Christ, we may annoy each other and get on one another’s nerves. There are many difficulties which could cause angry reactions. It seems we could never have peace. When we look at our church life from a certain angle, we may feel all is hopeless, for the problems seem innumerable. When we pray together, however, we touch grace. Suddenly, our Christian brothers and sisters become so sweet. It seems impossible, but we now love those who once annoyed us. This is because peace issues from grace. We not only have peace with the Lord but also have peace with the believers He has placed us with (1 Cor. 12:18). When we acknowledge His lordship, we experience real peace.
