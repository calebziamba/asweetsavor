> _“Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are differences of operation, but it is the same God who operates all things in all.”_
> 
> _(1 Corinthians 12:4-6)_

Everyone should be so bold: Praise the Lord! I have the Spirit! And I am gifted! Everyone should have this kind of boldness. I am a gifted brother in the recovery. But not to coordinate toilet paper. I have some gift because I do have the Spirit. There are “differences of gifts, but the same Spirit.” This very Spirit that comes to you, and comes to me, and comes to many brothers and sisters, immediately produces all kinds of gifts. And not all the gifts are alike.
