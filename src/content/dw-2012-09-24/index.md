_Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. — Song of Songs 4:4, KJV_

The sixth item the Lord praises is her neck. In the Bible, the neck refers to man’s will. In chapter 1, the Lord said, “Your neck is beautiful with strings of jewels” (1:10).  Now He says, “Your neck is like the tower of David built for an armory.”

Being like the tower, she is not bent over with eyes cast upon the earth as one bound by Satan. Her will has been so strengthened that she is no longer enslaved to the world or affected by Satan.
