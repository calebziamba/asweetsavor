_“Your lips, my bride, drip honey;_ _Honey and milk are under your tongue,_ _And the fragrance of your garments Is like the fragrance of Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:11_

After praising the seeker’s love and her fragrance, the Lord continues, “Your lips drip fresh honey, my bride; honey and milk are under your tongue; and the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon” (4:11). Our lips, which represent our words and our speaking, drip honey.

Honey is one of the richest and most enlivening of all foods. What we say becomes full of the reviving power of life. When we speak for the Lord with honey, our words are full of life. They drop slowly as the honeycomb. We are so rich that we are not in a hurry to pour out what we have; our words drop slowly as honey from the honeycomb. As such persons, we can release what the Lord has committed to us wherever we are.
