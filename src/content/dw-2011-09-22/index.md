_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”_ _Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the fields of Jaar. Let us go into His tabernacle; Let us worship at His footstool. Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, And let Your saints shout for joy. — Psalm 132:1-9_

As we have said, the Old Testament example of the ark being separated from the tabernacle (cf. 1 Sam. 4) corresponds to how we often feel about the church life. Therefore in Psalm 132 we see a mature person who is struggling.

He does not struggle for how he can grow, how he can be used by the Lord, or how he can become a blessing. He has already gained all of these things through his previous experiences, but he is still not satisfied. He cries out, “Lord, I am not just here to be a blessing to others. I am not just here to render the church a supply of life and enjoyment. Lord, I am after the ark of testimony! I am after the substance of the church life!” This should be our struggle. We should struggle that the church life would be filled with reality.
