_Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev. Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening._ _– Genesis 24:62–63_

Once we have been consecrated to God and are designated as His heirs, God brings us into the riches of Christ as our good land. All these riches are ours. Whatever we need, we have in Christ. If we are dry, there are fountains and springs. If we need the work of the cross, there is wheat. If we need the power of resurrection, there is barley. If we need life, there are vines. No matter what we need, we can find it in Christ. He is so rich and is everything we need. We don’t need anything other than Him. Praise the Lord for the good land in our spirit today! If we partake of Him in our spirit, His riches will become our reality and experience.
