_“Among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.” — Matt. 11:11_ John the Baptist was greater than every person who came before him. Of all the Old Testament saints —œ Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel —œ not one was greater. But the Lord also said something surprising: “Yet he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.” That means every person who is born again is greater than John the Baptist.

We often consider ourselves to be small and insignificant, but we should not look down on ourselves. The Lord Jesus said that we are greater than John the Baptist, who in turn was greater than all of God's people who came before him. Even if we have only been saved a short time, we are extremely special to the Lord. We are greater than all of the Old Testament forefathers. We are greater than John the Baptist ever was. Praise the Lord, we have been born again! We have a new life, a new position, and the necessity of a new living. That is why we are so great and so precious in the Lord's eyes.
