_“Oh, you are beautiful, my love! Oh, you are beautiful!” — Song of Songs 1:15a_

Brothers and sisters, what a precious praise this is! This verse is for all those whose Beloved is to them a bundle of myrrh. It is not only for the saints who are faithful as those in the night, but also for those who realize the beauty of the henna flower and live in the vineyards of En-gedi. In particular, it is for those who consider themselves so weak that they only can rely on the Lord’s death and desire that the Lord would work in them more deeply.

Few of us can elicit this particular praise from the Lord. We usually think that our experience of the Lord’s life is somehow adequate. But I want to ask, how much do we really give the Lord? How much desire do we really have for the Lord? Or do we just focus on work or on what others think of us? We need to remember that no matter how much we labor or how zealous we are, we still need to remain in En-gedi. No matter how busy we are, we still have to live in the “night.” Then the Lord will say that we are beautiful. May the Lord enlighten us and reveal His intent and pleasure to us.
