After giving us a basic introduction to God's economy in the book of Romans, Paul’s next three books tell us that after being saved, we will encounter many problems as we grow in the Christian life—problems in the local church life (1 Corinthians), problems between the believers and those who minister to them (2 Corinthians), and problems with religion (Galatians).

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 3-4.
