_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

In Lucifer’s effort to seize equality with God, he said, “I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God....I will make myself like the Most High” (Isa. 14:13–14). He wanted to be able to say, “No!” when God said, “Yes!” and to say, “Yes!” when God said, “No!” This is what brought in God’s judgment.

Fallen humanity now has this same kind of mind. It can be seen in human society and even in the church life—the mind to seize equality. This is offensive to God. In His body, there is an organic order. In this order, everyone is necessary, although each is placed differently (1 Cor. 12:18). Every member is precious, and we must appreciate and value what others have.
