Before Noah, it seemed that God had hope that His purpose could be fulfilled by man. However, at the time of Noah, mixture came in, and man was exposed as being hopeless. God detests mixture. He loves purity and everything after its kind. Today God is cleansing us of our mixture. We either belong to God, or we belong to Satan. We cannot serve two masters. When God saw the mixture at Noah’s time, He sent the flood to destroy it. Eventually, only the eight people in Noah’s household were saved.
