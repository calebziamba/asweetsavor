_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

In verse 15, the Greek word for “above reproach” is _ámômos_, meaning without spot or without blemish (Rienecker, p. 552). It is the same Greek word used in Ephesians 1:4 and 5:27. The Lord is building His church with precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 124.
