_David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down to him. And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. — 1 Samuel 22:1-2_

_Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand. And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. — 1 Samuel 23:4-5_

David worked with whoever the Lord brought to him—the distressed, the debtors, and the discontented. Who but David was willing to work with people like this? He raised them up, forming them into a fighting force to establish his kingdom.

Isn’t this encouraging? Everyone should pray, “Lord, I am full of problems and don’t have much, but I give myself to You to become one of Your mighty men for the sake of Your kingdom, that Your purpose may be accomplished on earth.”
