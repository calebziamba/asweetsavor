_I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy, for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. â€” Philippians 1:3-6_

Sometimes we harass those around us in the name of some principle of the Body. Brothers and sisters, the church life should be pure, and the church life must be focused upon Christ. We should not investigate others in order to point out our differences under the guise of fellowship. Instead of holding up the things that differ, we should enjoy the reality of our oneness by taking Christ as our unique focus. I should give you my Christ, and you should give me your Christ! Then we have communion with one another in life.
