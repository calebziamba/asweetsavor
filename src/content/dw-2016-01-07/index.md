_And Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech._ _–  Genesis 5:25_

Lamech means “the wild man” (Easton). To accomplish His will, the Lord needs Lamechs who are willing to be crazy for Him. Not only should we be like Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, but we should also have the expression of Lamech.  We should not only have the good report but also the evil report from the religious people. If this is our case, we are blessed.

May we all be so wild that we tell the Lord, “If You don’t work, I won’t let You rest.” We must become Lamech! We must be strong, not caring for anything but the Lord’s interest. The Lord will only have His way in the church when He gains a group of people like this!
