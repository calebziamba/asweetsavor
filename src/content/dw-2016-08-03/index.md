It seems that no one is as absolute as Paul was. He was absolute towards what he thought was right. When he was a Jew, he was a real Jew. When he became a Christian, he totally left Judaism, yet for his kinsmen he was willing to pay any price.

Hardly any of us have Paulâ€™s absoluteness. Absoluteness was part of his character. Praise the Lord for this. Since the divine nature was constituted in him and became the inner essence of his character, his absoluteness was useful to the church.
