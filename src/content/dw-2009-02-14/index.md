_But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ. — Philippians 3:7-8_ The divine flow is not for making demands or producing slogans; it is for delivering us from everything other than Christ. When the flow carries us, the world is gone. If the flow is truly among us, saint after saint in church after church will be liberated from any thought of a worldly future, whether material or religious. If we are in the flow, we can shout, “Hallelujah! I have no future in the world, and I have no future in religion. I am just for God's economy.”
