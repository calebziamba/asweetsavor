_From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory._

_— Joshua 1:4_

The Lord encouraged Joshua by reminding him of the extent of the land He had promised to Israel as an inheritance (Josh 1:4). If we feel weak and discouraged, it is probably because we have forgotten the glorious inheritance God has promised. We are called to fight for what is on God’s heart.
