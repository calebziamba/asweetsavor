_“And pasture your young goats_ _By the tents of the shepherds.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:8_

We must learn that every shepherd has his “tent.” The Lord allows us to work, but He does not allow us to work individually, apart from others. To work properly for God, we need to be by the shepherds’ tents and be related to these tents. We cannot try to carry out our burden independently, according to our own way and opinion. We have to learn to bring our burden to the brothers, bringing to the church what the Lord has committed to us. Then we will truly be able to care for others. We should pasture our young goats by the shepherds’ tents.
