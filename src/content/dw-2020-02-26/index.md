_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

We are here to gain Christ. Yet sometimes when we hear others speak about Christ, we pass that speaking along to others without allowing that portion of Christ to become our own. We are distracted from Christ by a teaching concerning Him.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, pages 181-182.
