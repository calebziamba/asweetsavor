God’s wisdom is boundless and His work surpasses all our expectations. When He looks at us, He sees beyond our success or failure, strength or weakness. He doesn’t hold a whip in His hand, ready to punish us. He has His plan and desire for us. His leading takes us far beyond what we could hope for. He allows us to strive with Him and prevail so that we may know ourselves. It seems at first that He obeys our desires and complies with our will. When we have a need, He hurries to meet it. It seems that He can never prevail over us. We must thank Him that He is so grand. He allows us to prevail in our pursuing and serving so that we may know ourselves. But eventually He brings us to the place where He overcomes and we willingly submit to Him. His seeming weakness causes us to bow before Him.

We cannot but say, “Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who became His counselor? Or who has first given to Him that it might be paid back to Him again? For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen” (Rom. 11:33–36). When we see the Lord again, we can only say, “I am not worthy, Lord. I am only here because of the work of Your Spirit in me!”
