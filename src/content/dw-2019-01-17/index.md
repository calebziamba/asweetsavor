After the Lord appeared to Isaac in Beersheba, Isaac “built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there” (Gen. 26:25). One who has met God can only live a life of the altar and tent. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were patterns of the called ones. Abraham dwelt “in tents with Isaac and Jacob...for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God” (Heb. 11:9–10).
