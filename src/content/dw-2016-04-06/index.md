_Then it came about at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made; and he sent out a raven, and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth. â€“ Genesis 8:6-7_

After the flood, Noah lived in the fresh experience of resurrection life. As the waters receded, he sent out a raven. Ravens are unclean animals (Lev. 11:15) that eat the flesh of carcasses, so they are related to death. When the raven saw so many bodies floating on the water, it had no desire to return to the ark. This shows that outside the ark there was nothing but sin, darkness, and death.
