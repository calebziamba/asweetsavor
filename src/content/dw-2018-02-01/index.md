_Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”_ _– John 14:6_

Our first need as Christians is to enjoy the life of Christ, for if we don’t enjoy Christ as our life, then we can’t have Him as anything else in our experience. It is only when we enjoy Christ as life that we will be able to experience Him as all the other items He is to us.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 86.
