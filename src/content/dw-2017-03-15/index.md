_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure._ _—Philippians 2:12–13_

We should be in fear lest we miss this marvelous salvation, which is totally wrapped up in Christ. Today we must faithfully bring to completion this salvation that the Lord is working out in us.
