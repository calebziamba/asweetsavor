> let’s keep living by that same _standard_ to which we have attained. Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.

> \-- Philippians 3:16-17 NASB

The Greek word for “living” in verse 16 is _stoicheō_, which means to march in military rank, to keep step, or to walk orderly (Strong, no. 4748). In verse 17, the Greek word for “walk” is _peripateō_, which refers to the walk that is free, “to tread all around, i.e., walk at large” (Strong, no. 4043).

The degree of our attainment of Christ becomes both the boundary and sphere of our walk. It is the boundary restricting our orderly walk (_stoicheō_) and the sphere in which we walk freely (_peripateō_) within that boundary.
