_I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. â€” Song of Songs 1:5_

On the one hand, you are like the tents of Kedar, black inwardly and outwardly, having nothing of beauty. One the other hand, you are like the curtains of Solomon; you are of fine linen. You are lovely inwardly because Christ's righteousness is your covering.

On the one hand, you consider yourself to be so poor. On the other hand, when you see the salvation in Christ, you feel that you are so rich and beautiful. This situation is the result of being with the King in His chambers.
