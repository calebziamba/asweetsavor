_through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name’s sake._  
_–_ _Romans_ _1:5_

Romans 1:5 tells us that the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, is not only the center of the gospel, but also the source of the operation of the gospel. Paul says that, “through \[Him\] we have received grace and apostleship.” Both are for “obedience of faith among all the Gentiles.” The gospel is not static, but is always operating to cause people to become obedient to the faith and to experience the judicial redemption and organic salvation within the gospel.

The gospel operates by flowing from its center, Jesus Christ, to those who are being saved. It will eventually transform sinners one by one into sons of God. This transformation results in a healthy and godly human life and in a church life that magnifies Christ. The gospel is the Son of God, but even more it is the Son of God in operation!
