_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

_But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world._ _—Galatians 6:14_

If the Lord gives us a revelation, that revelation requires our salvation. If I have some gift, that gift requires that I experience more salvation. Our self-life too easily appropriates for our own use the things the Lord has given us for our salvation. How we need to be saved from our self-life! We need salvation so that nothing replaces Christ as our boast and source of confidence (Gal. 6:14; Eph. 3:12).
