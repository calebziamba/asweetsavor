> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
> 
> – Philippians 4:7 (ESV)

The Lord may not answer our prayers and petitions in the way we desire because His answer is not according to our thought, but according to our need of transformation. We may have a specific need, and it is proper that we pray for it, but the Lord desires something much higher for us than we realize. Therefore, the Lord may not answer our prayers in the manner we expect, yet we will experience the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension. We may not get what we want, but the peace is there. The peace of God will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus because we have a prayer life.
