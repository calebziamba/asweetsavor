We usually think that those who follow the Lord are people who live in Christ, have God, and magnify God. This concept is normal and healthy. But if someone tells us that the leading brothers made some mistakes and that the elders quarreled in the meeting, immediately our fear and godliness depart. And if we lose our fear and godliness, it is hard for us to grow properly in the divine life.
