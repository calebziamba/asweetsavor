__“Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:8__

As the Lord calls us forward to be with Him in His ascension, He emphasizes that those who are with Him in His ascension can abide in the reality of the truth. What you speak and what you live should no longer be separate. What you say has to be your reality.

You need to pay the price to experience the reality of truth, and for the truth to become your reality. You don’t just buy a little myrrh, but you dwell in the mountain of myrrh, which the Lord will sell to you.

If you really desire to go to the mountain of myrrh, you have to be willing to cast everything else away. Do not be anxious. Do not worry. Do not plan. Do not think too much. Your life is in the Lord’s hand. You live by faith before the Lord. What you hear and what you speak of the truth has to become your reality.
