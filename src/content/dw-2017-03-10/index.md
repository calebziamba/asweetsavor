_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

To be saved from our self-life, we have no other recourse but to abandon ourselves to God and cry out, “O Lord, save me!” We need to be saved from all things we think we can do apart from God, and especially the things we do for God.

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ,”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 117-118.
