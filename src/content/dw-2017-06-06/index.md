_God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth._ _– John 4:24_

The Lord doesn’t want us to simply have certain kinds of moods, feelings, zeal, or excitement, nor is it His desire to simply give us physical blessings. We may desire to enjoy such things, but the Lord would tell us that such things won’t last very long. The Lord wants us to enjoy Him as a living person! He would say, “I don’t want to give you good feelings, excitement, or blessings. I want to give you Myself to enjoy.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 73.
