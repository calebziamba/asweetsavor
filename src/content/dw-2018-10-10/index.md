Fellowship is the flowing of life. In fellowship we establish a life-relationship with one another. Fellowship does not necessarily mean that some direction will be set. Many times we say we want fellowship, but what we really want is a decision. We may reach a decision, but that is not the main objective of fellowship.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 144.
