_“My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh  
Which lies all night between my breasts.”  
– Song of Songs 1:13  
_

If you experience something of the dealings and the breaking work of the cross, you will consider it very precious. When you touch the cross the Lord has measured to you, and when it works on you, you will be changed, and the fragrance of spikenard will spontaneously flow out. You will begin to experience what it is to be in the heavenly places with Christ. At that time you will be able to provide God with some satisfaction, for you are more willing to allow the cross to do its work, and thus your person is being gained for the Lord.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, pages 60-61.
