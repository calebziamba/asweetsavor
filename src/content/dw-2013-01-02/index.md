_The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me,_ _And I said, 'Have you seen him whom my soul loves?'_ _— Song of Songs 3:3_

After the Lord has withdrawn His presence from us, we come to the second step of His dealings with us, in which we are moved in our distress to open up our situation to the other brothers and sisters. In the Song of Songs this is portrayed by the Shulammite’s saying that she will arise from her bed and go into the city to seek the Lord (3:2).

After this, He leads us to the experienced brothers and sisters, who are like “the watchmen who go about in the city” (3:3). These experienced saints help us to become more established and constituted before the Lord.
