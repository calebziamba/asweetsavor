> ...that I may gain Christ and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith

Our being found in Christ is actually in three stages.

Secondly, this faith enables us to be found in Christ’s present work. We may be found in Christ according to His completed work, but are we found in what the Lord is doing now? When the Lord is advancing, we should advance with Him. When the Lord is working, we should work with Him. This is a further stage—we are found in Christ because we live according to Him.
