If a person has a transformed nature, but does not develop a healthy personality, the ones whom he serves will suffer because he is so “spiritual.” When you fellowship with him, he will say, “The Lord will take care of everything. What does the Lord say?” But this is the reason you go to him—you don’t know what the Lord is saying. If you tell him this, he will say, “You don’t know? You have to learn to know the teaching of the anointing.” You are in the most urgent situation and are trying to find a way out, yet he still tells you to learn the teaching of the anointing. He indeed has the divine nature. However, since he doesn’t have a good character, his personality becomes peculiar. He cannot enter into the situation of others, and he doesn’t understand where people are. A person with this kind of personality cannot serve others.
