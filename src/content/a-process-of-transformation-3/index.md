> And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what _is_ that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
> 
> \- Romans 12:2

Do you realize God desires both of us to be one, that regardless of whatever the field we are in, we are both for God’s purpose, for God’s economy, for God’s will, and for the will of God. You know brothers, this is the first transformation God brings you out of: out of your own scope, your own field of life, your own hope, your your own expectations. God desires to bring you out of your own plan of life. God says “You can do anything but it has to be for my purpose, my will, my desire, you must be one with my will. Renew your mind.” Brothers, renew your minds so you will know what the will of God is.
