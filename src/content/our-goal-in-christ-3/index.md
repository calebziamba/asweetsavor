Some Christians, after reading through the Bible many times, feel they have mastered it. They feel they know what every verse is talking about and have received its totality. Yet Paul never felt this way. To him, Christ was an unlimited expanse to be explored. Christ had laid hold of Paul. Now Paul wanted to lay hold of Christ. He realized that he had not yet attained or been perfected. What a wide open plain of the unsearchable riches of Christ lay before him!
