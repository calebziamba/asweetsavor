_For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged._

_— 1 Corinthians 14:31_

According to Paul in the fourteenth chapter of First Corinthians, we all can prophesy, and we all can be prophets. If you wish to speak for the Lord as a prophet, however, you must meet five requirements. First, your person must be healthy before the Lord. Second, the word you speak must become spirit. Third, the word you speak must have content. Fourth, the word you speak must be with a burden. Finally, you must have an adequate utterance. How well you are able to minister depends upon your ability to satisfy these five requirements.
