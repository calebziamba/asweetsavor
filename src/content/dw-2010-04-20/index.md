_Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Blessed are you of the Lord, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich.” — Ruth 3:10_ Ruth wanted to give herself to Boaz rather than to any younger man whom she might marry. The Lord, our Boaz, is all-valuable, all-sufficient, and almighty. He is the Lord of lords and the King of kings. He is the possessor of everything. He is the most desirable One, but often we don’t see Him this way, so we are attracted by the young men.

What are the young men? They are the things other than Christ which we pursue and give our lives to. For example, we might let our desire for a position in a company replace Christ. The Lord realizes that from our point of view, that is a premier company. There is a big world out there, with so many appealing things to which we can give ourselves. If we choose Him over these, He appreciates that. Our kindness is manifested in that the world is so attractive, and yet we give up the world to choose Christ. We all must honestly admit, however, that we are glad we have not chosen any of the young men and have rather selected the One who is truly worthy of our life.
