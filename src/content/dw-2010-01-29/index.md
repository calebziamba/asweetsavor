_“If you do not know, O fairest among women, follow in the footsteps of the flock, and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.” —Song of Songs 1:8_

“The footsteps of the flock” is plural in number, signifying the spiritual walk of all the believers. From the pouring out of the Spirit at Pentecost throughout all church history, the real followers of the Lord have demonstrated their love in the midst of persecution, sacrifice, and even martyrdom. Many are still following this way to love the Lord today. We need to trace these steps and continue along this way that the saints before have trod.

The principles of spiritual growth will never change. Just as the Lord helped Peter, James, John, Paul, and many other saints to grow in life at that time, so will the Lord lead you today. If you are wandering alongside the flocks of your companions feeling depressed, it is good to read some biographies of those who loved the Lord before. The story of their experiences with the Lord will supply you and help you through your difficulties.

We need to realize that nourishment and rest can be found not only through our pursuit of the Lord directly, but also from the spiritual experiences of other brothers and sisters. Today the flock has gone quite a distance, leaving many footsteps for us to follow. What we need to do is to go forth in these footsteps of the flock.
