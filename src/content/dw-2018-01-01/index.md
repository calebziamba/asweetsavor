_“The Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys.”_ _– Genesis 24:35_

After Rebekah finished watering the camels, the servant brought out a golden ring and two golden bracelets for her and asked, “Whose daughter are you?” (Gen. 24:23). She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor” (v. 24).

Rebekah brought the servant to her family’s home where he met her brother, Laban, and her father, Bethuel. Then the servant had a wonderful testimony. He testified for Abraham, representing God the Father, and for Isaac, representing Christ the Son. The Holy Spirit doesn’t testify for Himself but for the Father and the Son (John 15:26; 16:13–14).
