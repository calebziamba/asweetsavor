_Then David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your sight, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”_ _— First Samuel 27:5_

After all of David’s experiences of retreating and escaping, he eventually returned to the place where he had first sought refuge outside of Israel. This time, however, the outcome was very different. He asked for a city and received Ziklag, which remained a part of Judah from then on.

Shouldn’t we be so bold? We should tell the Lord, “I do not want to live a common life. I would like my Christian life to be so adventurous. As I serve You, I know there will be a lot of downs, but also a lot of ups. I will be persecuted, but I will also have much encouragement. As I go through these things, I will become different, even a reigning king.”
