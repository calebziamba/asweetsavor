When we labor or when we shepherd others, our realization should be that we, like them, are in weakness. When we desire that some would love the Lord more, we ourselves must struggle to love the Lord more. When we desire that they consecrate themselves to Christ, we must struggle to consecrate ourselves to Him. When we desire that our church would become prevailing, we must realize that we ourselves are just as weak as the weakest member.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 149.
