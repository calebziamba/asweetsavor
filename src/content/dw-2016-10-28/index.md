_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. —Philippians 2:8–11_

All who have ever lived—whether angels, demons, or men—must bow to this name, and every tongue must confess, recognizing He is Lord. Hallelujah! This One is on the throne! Yet even Christ being confessed as Lord is to the Father’s glory, not to His own. We say, “Jesus is Lord!” and this glorifies God. From beginning to end, everything that Christ has passed through has been to accomplish God’s desire. This is the mind of Christ, the mind we must have in our church life.
