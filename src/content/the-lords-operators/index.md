The Lord says, “I’m holding the seven stars. These stars are the messengers. These stars are also the operators.” If a sister says, “I have a need,” the Lord can say, “Don’t worry. There are operators.” If a junior higher says, “I’m just in junior high,” then the Lord says, “Don’t worry, I have operators.” If a brother really loves the Lord and shouts, “I want to grow!” then the Lord will say, “Don’t worry, the operators will help you to grow.” If a brother says, “I’m so bored. I’m so dead,” then the Lord will say, “Don’t worry, there’s an operator to bring you out of your boredom, to bring you out of your death.” How can I say a local church is blessed? It’s all based on this: do you have operators? An elder could be an operator. But more than that, you need many saints who are operators. When these saints operate in the church life, the whole church life can become strong.
