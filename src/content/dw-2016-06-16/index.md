Colossians 1:12 tells us that we should give thanks to the Father,

_who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light._

As those who are born again, we are “the saints in Light.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ,](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 50.
