You need to help young people in the most practical way. Help them to quit smoking or to style their hair properly. They all need very practical help. It would be good for you and your husband to care for some young people in a very practical way. Again, the more practical, the better. Help them in every practical aspect. Help them with their finances, their clothing, their daily living, and their hair, as well as their spiritual function, their labor in the word, and their releasing of their spirit. All these things need to be fellowshipped practically. If we do not know how to raise up the saints practically, they will not know how to go on with the Lord practically.
