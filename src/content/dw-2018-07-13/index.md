_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren._ _– Romans 8:29_

Romans presents a picture in which all of God’s work is for us. Everything He is and has helps us, establishes us, causes us to grow and mature, and constitutes us to become His useful servants.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 11.
