_“Awake, O north wind,_ _And come, wind of the south;_ _Make my garden breathe out fragrance,_ _Let its spices be wafted abroad._ _May my beloved come into his garden_ _And eat its choice fruits!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:16_

At this point the seeker’s concern is, “Lord, do You feel sweet when I come to You? Do You enjoy my prayer and my reflection? Do You feel that we are fully joined in spirit when I speak for You? Do you feel that we are one when I go visiting and testifying for You?”

She is united with the Lord to the extent that her garden indeed is the Lord’s garden. What a beautiful and glorious manifestation of life she has! We praise the Lord for this kind of living that we can experience with our Lord.
