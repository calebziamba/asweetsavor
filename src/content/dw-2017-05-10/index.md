_“Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you.”_ _– Genesis 13:17_

It is only when we rise up and begin to walk in Christ that we apprehend “the breadth and length and height and depth” of Christ as the reality of the promised land (Eph. 3:18). Little by little the unsearchable riches of Christ transfuse into us through our walking. This is what God meant when He told Abraham to rise up and walk through the land according to its length and its width. The land with all its riches is ours. Rise up and walk! Take possession of what God has promised!
