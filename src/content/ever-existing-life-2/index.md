> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.

Sometimes, some of us are so concerned about a weak believer who backslides until he doesn’t even seem to be a Christian anymore. Did he lose his salvation? Some such people even question whether there is a God, and may even say they made a mistake when they prayed and that they didn’t really believe! Let me ask you which do you really believe – the eternal life, or what he says? You must realize that when God enters someone’s spirit as life, it does not matter what that person may think in his mind. It will not chase this life away. Even if a person who has received this life blasphemes God, God will not be moved. He is self-existing and ever-existing. One day God will remind that person that He is there, and the person will wake up!
