_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

To be perfumed is to absorb a fragrance and then to spread its aroma. Perfuming takes time. If it were a matter of being roasted, it might take less time, but you would not be able to endure it. To be perfumed requires a long process.

If you don’t want to pay the price to be perfumed and instead you run away from the perfuming process, you will only delay the Lord; He will gain you eventually. His intention is to gain each one of us fully until our entire being is perfumed with His death and resurrection.
