_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

Pillars of smoke allude to the power of the Spirit. The Lord will work on you until you become someone who is able to shepherd and lead others, someone who can enlighten and render help.

When you become such a person, the church is able to move forward, for you are able to lead people through the wilderness just as the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire led Israel. Then when you speak for the Lord, others will be affected by the riches you have been constituted with, and you will be a blessing to the church.
