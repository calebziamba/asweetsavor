God’s desire to have Israel as a peculiar treasure, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation inspired Joshua to give himself to the Lord and to serve only Him.

When God first called Moses, He selected Aaron to work with Moses (Exo. 4:14–15; 7:1), but who selected Joshua? The Bible does not tell us. Joshua, along with a man named Hur, seems to have been selected by Moses along the way. His name had been Hoshea (Num. 13:8), which means deliverer, but Moses changed it to Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means Jehovah is salvation. Moses may have said, “Young man, you are not the deliverer; salvation is of Jehovah!”

From the first time he appears in the record, Joshua is marked by his commitment to God.
