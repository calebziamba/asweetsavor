_And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul’s hand. And Saul cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice. — First Samuel 18:10-11_

_That the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ. — First Peter 1:7_

If you feel others are in your way, you are looking at things as though you are in an institution, not the Lord’s organic body. Rather, you should stand with those you think are in your way. Serve with them and help them! Do this and you will become fruitful. You will find you possess approvedness.

However, if you just feel blocked, you will not find approvedness no matter how trained you are. You will wonder why others seem cold toward you. Actually, they are not the problem. The whole situation is to test you. Only through such testing will you find opportunities to be approved.
