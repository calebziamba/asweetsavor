_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

When we have the realization that we must always be ready to bear fruit, we will find that the door is open. We meet someone who is in need. We meet someone who is seeking the Lord. We meet someone who is ready to be saved. Actually, this is true all the time, but we don’t sense it, because we are too occupied with what needs to be done and are not seeking to grow and beget. This is why, after we are buried and are full of life, we must still look for the opportunities that present themselves for us to grow and bear fruit and be exercised to reap the benefit.
