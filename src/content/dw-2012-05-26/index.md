_“The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’ Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me.” — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

Now she dares not leave the Lord. She cannot walk without the presence of the Lord. If the Lord is still with her, she is joyful. If He seems to be gone, she becomes so nervous that she has to stop and call, “Oh, Lord,” until she senses Him again. She is still bound by her feelings. She doesn’t yet realize that the Lord’s presence is always with her.
