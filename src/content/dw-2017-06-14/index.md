_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_ _– John 1:29_

Even when we tell the Lord, “I love You,” we experience Him as the Lamb. The more we say, “Lord Jesus, I love You,” and the more we take Him as a person, the more Christ as the Lamb of God becomes subjective to us. We realize, “Because of the Lamb, I’m so clean, so sanctified, and so purified. I have no more sins. I have no more problems.”

We don’t need to pray, “Oh, Lord Jesus, take away this sin,” or, “Lord Jesus, help me overcome that sin.” We just need to enjoy Christ as the Lamb of God.
