_Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’”_ _– John 7:37-38_

In our human life, we need to eat, and we also need to drink. This means we need to be strengthened, and we also need to be refreshed. No matter how much we enjoy Christ as the bread of life, we also need Him as the water of life.
