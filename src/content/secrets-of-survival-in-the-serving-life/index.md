These messages were given in May and June of 1985 to brothers and sisters participating in a year-long labor in the Bible. Sometimes they were spoken to the trainees together with the rest of the church, but more frequently they were talks with those in the labor. Brother Titus’ burden came out of Paul’s first epistle to Timothy and focused upon how we may grow fully into what God has arranged for us despite all the frustrations and dangers which confront us as we are growing. Those who were present can testify how much they continue to be helped by our brother’s fellowship on this crucial matter.

“Survival” in these messages does not denote a passive continuance; rather, it is the exercise which enables us to attain to our measure of growth and function in the Body. What is shared in these messages are not “how to’s,” but principles which can protect us as we are growing and help ensure that our exercise will become an ever-increasing profit to the Lord for His recovery.

##### [Article 1: Survival is for Growth unto Our Measure](/wp-content/uploads/secrets-to-survival-01.pdf)

To survive in the church life means much more than to simply continue coming to the meetings. Rather, it means that despite so much outward discouragement and the fact that so many fall away, we continue to pursue the Lord and His desire. Through such a pursuing, such a surviving, we develop a mature appreciation of the Lord and become the genuine shepherds in the church life. All of this requires us to have a learning spirit.

##### [Article 3: Receiving Our Savior God’s Arrangement in our Environment](/wp-content/uploads/secrets-to-survival-03.pdf)
