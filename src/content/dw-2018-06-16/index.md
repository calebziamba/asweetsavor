_This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you._ _â€“ John 15:12_

The first commission the Lord gave us is to love one another. We need to love one another in the body of Christ, to the point that, as the Lord did for us, we would forsake our lives for our fellow believers. We should learn to lay down our lives for the sake of our brothers and sisters by being absolutely poured out for their sake. We should also learn how to impart the divine life into the saints. This is what it truly means to love one another according to the first commission the Lord gave to us.
