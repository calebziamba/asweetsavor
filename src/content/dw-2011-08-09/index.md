_“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage.” — Joshua 1:9_ Many servants of the Lord have gone before us. Now the Lord is calling us to serve Him. Therefore, we should be strong and of good courage. We should not be afraid or dismayed. We may be worried about the details of our future, but the Lord tells us, “The Lord your God is with you wherever you go” (v. 9).
