_“Stay this night.” —Ruth 3:13a_ How long is this night experience for us? Six years? Twenty? In our experience there is a long process of growth while we lie submissively at Christ’s feet and enjoy His warm protection. Yet during this process we still do not know the release Christ can render or the full experience of oneness with Him.

The Lord’s work upon us seems to come most often while we are in the night. Every time we consecrate ourselves, our consecration brings us into the experience of night rather than day. When we declare, “Lord, I give myself to You,” He asks, “Are you ready?” If we reply, “Lord, I am,” then be prepared. Something that seems disheartening is about to happen. However, at the same time, we sense that the Lord is with us, for we remain at His feet. We sense that He is covering us, but it is still night in our experience.
