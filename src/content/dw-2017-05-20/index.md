If we desire to live according to the new life we received when we were born again, then we need to ask ourselves: What is the new living that we should have after being born again? The answer to this question is very simple. According to the Bible, our new living is one of enjoyment. That is, we who are born again should have a living in which we enjoy Christ day by day, and in which we constantly enjoy the riches of our salvation.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 70.
