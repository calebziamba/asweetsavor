_“Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has.”_ _– Genesis 24:36_

_“All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes of Mine and will disclose it to you.”_ _– John 16:15_

The servant not only testified of Abraham but also of Isaac. God loves His Son, His only begotten Son. All the riches of the Father are the riches of the Son. He is God and He has given everything to His Son (John 3:35). All the riches belong to our Lord.
