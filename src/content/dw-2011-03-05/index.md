_“As an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste." — Song of Songs 2:3_ Brothers and sisters, when you first began to follow the Lord, you longed only for the feeling of the Lord’s presence. The Lord gave you some speaking, some leading, and some enlightenment. However, your enjoyment of life was limited until, due to the work of the cross and the help of the church, you entered into a further enjoyment of this life. At that point, your couch became green.

Then as this unlimited life continued to grow in you, you could tell others, “The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are cypresses.” Now you are no longer in the smaller sphere where you were experiencing Christ primarily for yourself. Rather, you have entered into the enjoyment of the bountiful supply of life so that your whole being now can be for the church. You have grown in His life.
