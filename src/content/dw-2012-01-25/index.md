_"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away. For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. The flowers have already appeared in the land; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land. The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away!'" — Song of Songs 2:10-13_

Although this is a sober time, it is also a time of beauty. The appearing of flowers indicates that the abundant life has become manifested among the saints. God has an eternal purpose, and the purpose is carried out through the saints’ transformation. When you are with the saints, you should have a feeling that flowers are appearing on the earth!

Next we are told, “The time of singing has come” (2:12). At such a time, people praise God, and their praise is real and practical. Such praising is beautiful before the Lord. It is just like music. “The time of singing has come!”
