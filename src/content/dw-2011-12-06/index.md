_So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants. â€” First Samuel 18:5_

As believers, we should seek manifestation. Even young people should have such an aspiration. We should not be overly concerned whether or not this desire is from our soul-life. We should fight to make our mark before the Lord and then let the Lord work on us. We should experience fruit from our gospel preaching; we should see impact when we share; and we should be appreciated by others in the church, including the more experienced ones. All these are experiences of being manifested.
