_Go to My brethren and say to them, “I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.”_ _– John 20:17_

To say that Jesus is the Firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29) means that He is the pioneering One. Through His death and resurrection He uplifted the human nature, and now we need to follow Him by going through that same process. That is, our human nature is also being uplifted as we experience the cross (Rom. 6:4) and partake of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). In this way, we will become the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, the Firstborn son of God.
