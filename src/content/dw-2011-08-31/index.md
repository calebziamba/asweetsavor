When I look back, I have to marvel. Immediately after my experience of the Spirit when the elders laid their hands on me, I began to seek the Lord regarding where I should go to college. I wrongly assumed I would never be qualified to attend Taiwan University. One day, as I rode my bike past Normal College, I asked the Lord to please send me to that school. I was indeed admitted there, but only into the Boy Scout program, a two-year program with no degree. The Lord gave me what I asked for, but I realized I had not specified which program I wanted.
