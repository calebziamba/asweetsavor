_“Tell me, O you whom my soul loves,_ _Where do you pasture your flock,_ _Where do you make it lie down at noon?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

In this verse the seeker also asks the Lord where He makes His flock to “lie down at noon.” Noon is the “full” time of a day, as Proverbs 4:18 states:

_But the path of the righteous_ _is like the light of dawn,_ _That shines brighter and brighter_ _until the full day._

To “lie down” means to rest. Therefore, this verse indicates that the seeker desires to enter into something further with the Lord. She is not satisfied to just have a little service or some outward activities for the Lord. She is also longing for rest; not merely to work, but to enjoy the life supply of the Lord, even to the fullest extent.
