_A Psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who drove him away and he departed._

_I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul will make its boast in the Lord; The humble will hear it and rejoice. O magnify the Lord with me, And let us exalt His name together. I sought the Lord, and He heard me, And delivered me from all my fears. — Psalm 34:1-4_

David could have boasted in many things before, but now he had nothing to point to other than the Lord Himself. If he were to point somewhere in the cave, his finger would fall on one who was in distress, in debt, or discontented. Yet David could say to those around him,

_Oh, magnify the Lord with me, And let us exalt His name together. I sought the Lord, and He heard me, And delivered me from all my fears. — Psalm 34:3-4_
