_Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb. â€” Revelation 22:1_ In Revelation 22 there are no branches to this one flow from the throne of the New Jerusalem, for in eternity there will no longer be any need for what the branches represent. The begetting, perfecting, revelations, and building in life will be completed. Just one river will proceed out from the throne of God and of the Lamb. At that time everything will have been accomplished, and for eternity we will enjoy one river, the Lord Himself, as our satisfaction. Praise the Lord for this! May we all come to know the Lord as the flowing stream individually and corporately for our going on in these days! Praise Him!
