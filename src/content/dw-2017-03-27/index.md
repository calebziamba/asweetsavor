_For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,_ _– Romans 4:16_

Abraham is the father of faith (Rom. 4:11, 16). His faith came from God’s appearing (Gen. 15:1, 6). This is true even though it is hard to see Abraham’s faith in Genesis. Even though God had promised him a son (12:7; 13:15–16), he told God, “What will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” (Gen. 15:2). He also said, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” (17:18).
