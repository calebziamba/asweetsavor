_But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ. â€” Ephesians 2:13_ Does anyone believe that he only needs the blood of Christ a little bit? All day long every one of us needs the blood of Christ to speak for us!

In this blood we are all brought near. We all share the same status in the church because of the blood of Christ. You have the blood of Christ, and I also have the blood of Christ. In this blood we who were far off have become near.
