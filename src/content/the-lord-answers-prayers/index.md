Brother Titus shares two examples from his own experience of how, in his early days of serving the Lord, the Lord answered his prayers very directly.

Excerpted from [Hymns and Singing (2): Using Hymns to Ignite Our Prayer](https://www.asweetsavor.org/using-hymns-to-ignite-our-prayer/) of the [2009 Jesus Loversâ€™ Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/)
