_And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul’s hand. And Saul cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice. — First Samuel 18:10-11_

_That the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ. — First Peter 1:7_

I know a Christian brother who moved to the United States and was made an elder in a large church. Others heard of this and moved to the same area, thinking they might also be appointed to leadership positions. When this didn’t happen, they got disappointed and eventually moved back. Testing is not easy! If the Lord leads you to move somewhere, go with no expectations other than to find the Lord Himself. Many who think they have something expect to be appreciated and put to use so that they might do great things. They feel ready and think, “Aren’t I more capable than those who are already serving? Why don’t they recognize who I am and what I can do? Oh, if only those who are blocking me would step aside and give me a chance!” The Lord just doesn’t seem to cooperate; He allows this situation to manifest what is in your heart.
