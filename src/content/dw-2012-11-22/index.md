_Then it came about afterwards that David inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" And the Lord said to him, "Go up." So David said, "Where shall I go up?" And He said, "To Hebron."_ _— Second Samuel 2:1_

Hebron means society or friendship (Hitchcock), implying fellowship. The Lord intended that as David ruled, he would never leave the Lord’s presence. By sending David to Hebron, the Lord seemed to be saying, “I have been with you, and you have sought My face. You are the king now, and your kingship shall begin with an even more intimate fellowship between us.”
