_“Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” — Matthew 6:21_

In this world we can identify three kinds of people: those who seek money, those who seek fame, and those who seek power.

Those who love money occupy their minds with how to make money, use their emotion to love money, and exercise their will to determine to get money. Money thus occupies their entire person. Though they may love the Lord, they are not able to grow properly. The Lord is unable to equip them in their mind, for their mind is totally occupied with money.

“Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also” (Matt. 6:21). If your mind is set on money, then your heart is set on money, and your person also. Thus, your whole person is consumed with money.
