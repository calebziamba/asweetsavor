_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

_So Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him._ _– Hebrews 9:28_

The Lord tells us we should eagerly await His second coming “for salvation” (Heb. 9:28). At the same time, however, He warns us: Be careful! Do not neglect this salvation! (Heb. 2:3).
