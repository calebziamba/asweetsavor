_You are My friends if you do what I command you. — John 15:14_

_Casting all your anxiety on Him, because it matters to Him concerning you. — First Peter 5:7_

Try to practice opening up to the Lord Jesus as your friend. When you are home and have some time, try to open yourself to Him, even if it is just for a few minutes. Tell Him everything. Tell Him even about all the things that you think are too shameful, too low, or too insignificant. You may think that there are things you cannot tell Him, but that is not true. The more you are aware of such things, the more you should let Him know all about them.

You should tell the Lord, “Lord, I'm thankful that You are my Friend, and I can tell You everything. Lord, let me tell You about my problems. Let me tell You about my frustrations.” Only you know what your real problems are. If you say that you have no problems, then you must be God Himself. If you are not God, then surely you have problems and anxieties in your daily life. So what can you do? You should learn to enjoy Christ as a living person by opening your whole being to Him with all of your problems. He is your Friend, and He will listen to you. He knows, He understands, and He can fellowship with you and restore you.
