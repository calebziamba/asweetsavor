_“May you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem. May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring which the Lord will give you from this young woman.” — Ruth 4:11c–12_

Perez means _breaking forth_. Something was limited and held back, but now it breaks forth.
