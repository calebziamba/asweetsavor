_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all._ _— Philippians 1:2–4_

After greeting the Philippians, Paul began to share his heart with them in such a sweet way: “I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all” (Phil. 1:3–4). These two verses are profound. If we were writing to those we care for, we would probably end with, “I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,” since we sometimes don’t remember them. Paul went further, saying, “Always offering prayer.” It seems the Philippian believers occupied his heart all the time. He was always thinking of them and thanking God for them. In Paul’s Christian living of union and communion with Christ, the saints in Philippi were always with him.
