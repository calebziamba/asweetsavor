_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

The mind of Christ points us to the One who is carrying out God’s purpose. Whatever God desires, Christ desires. Because His mind was set upon God’s desire, He emptied Himself; He took the form of a bond-servant; He was made in the likeness of men. He chose to embrace God’s will, emptying Himself of every other possibility. How marvelous our Christ is!
