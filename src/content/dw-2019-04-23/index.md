_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

The experience of a normal Christian before the Lord is the song of songs. There are countless songs in the world, and everyone is pursuing and composing one of these songs. However, our Lord leads us to the most valuable song—the song of experiencing God. Some people are pursuing money, so money becomes the song of their lives. Some are pursuing power, and thus power becomes their song. We Christians need to enjoy the song that is above every other song, the song of songs.
