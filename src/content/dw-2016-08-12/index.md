_Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires._ _– Galatians 5:24_

_But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world._ _– Galatians 6:14_

We need the Lord’s mercy to preserve us. We are all the same. No one can ignore the danger that our personality may deteriorate. The world is always here. The flesh and its passions are always here.
