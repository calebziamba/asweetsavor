_\[Timothy\] was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium._  
_– Acts 16:1-2  
_

We should not give those around us the feeling that we are useless. Instead, they should feel we are full of zeal to the Lord and full of love to His people. To be approved by our own church is crucial. Because they are the ones who really see us, they are the ones who know us best.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, pages 155-156.
