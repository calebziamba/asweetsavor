_All the Father’s counsels claiming Equal honors to the Son, All the Son’s effulgence beaming, Makes the Father’s glory known._

_By the Spirit all pervading, Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb, Crowned with light and joy unfading, Hail Him as the great “I AM.”

— J.N. Darby_

When Mr. Darby wrote these lines he had a realization that God is the God of oneness, and that it is this God who produces the one accord.

Mr. Darby saw God’s economy intrinsically, in such a high, profound, and prevailing way. We have one God, yet He is Triune. The Father gives equal honors to the Son, the Son expresses the Father and makes His glory known, and the Spirit does everything around the Son with hosts unnumbered. Here we see one God, but in Him are three hypostases: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.
