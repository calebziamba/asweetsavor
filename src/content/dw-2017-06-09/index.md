The first way for us to enjoy Christ is as the Lamb of God. We see this in John 1:29, which says that John the Baptist

_saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 74.
