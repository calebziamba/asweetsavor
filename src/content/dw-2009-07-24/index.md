_Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling— Calling for you and for me; Patiently Jesus is waiting and watching— Watching for you and for me!_

_Come home! come home! Ye who are weary, come home! Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home!_

_— Will Lamartine Thompson_

Many years ago I remember an instance when a full-timer who was not very gifted in ministering had to preach in a gospel meeting. Many of the saints were a little nervous, because they knew of his difficulty in speaking. When the time came, however, he gave a very good message, using the words from the hymn:

_“Come home! Come home! All ye who are weary come home!”_ He did not speak for long, and ended his message with the call “Come home!” Rarely have I heard such a good gospel message. Although he was not eloquent, he used the word of God effectively, and brought in the Spirit. The word of God produced the anointing.
