_The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth._ _– John 1:14_

We should learn to enjoy God’s grace, and not just the blessings we receive from Christ. The problem is that many Christians develop a taste for outward blessings and never desire the Giver Himself.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 91.
