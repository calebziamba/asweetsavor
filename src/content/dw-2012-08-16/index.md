_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

If we want to become such a blessing, we should seek to be filled with the Spirit rather than becoming busy with work. We should allow the Lord’s hand to break us. Then through the scars imparted, our spirit may be released so that we may supply life to others.

One day we will find that neither our labor nor our work matter if we have not become pillars of smoke. May others be able to testify of us, “You have become like the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire in our midst. Because of you, the church is able to go forward.”
