> _The angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”_
> 
> \- Luke 1:19-20

Zacharias had a vision. I believe, when the angel told him, “You shall be mute,” all of a sudden he found out, “I can't hear anything. I can't speak anything.” Now, within him, he became very clear. The angel told him because of your unbelief. He began to consider, “I believe in God. I'm a priest. I'm serving God. Right? I've been serving God all of my life. I'm going to be a retired priest. Now, how can you say I don't believe?” The belief must be something new. It’s not the belief I used to think. Now, in my old belief, I'm sinful. The sin offering. I have problems. I offer a trespass offering. I don't live proper. I offer a meal offering. Now, I begin to think about something new. It’s more than just, “I have a situation and I offer something. It's a matter of “Now I see something”.
