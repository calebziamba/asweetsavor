Therefore, in this series of messages our brother fellowships with the saints about this matter of coming to the presence of the present Christ by means of calling, singing, Bible reading, prayer, and gathering with others.

##### [Message One: The Distinguishing Characteristic of the Lord’s Recovery is the Present Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/the-distinguishing-character-of-the-lords-recovery-is-the-present-christ/)

To live with the present Christ is to have Christ as the normality of your Christian life. It is normal, as a Christian, to always have something fresh of Christ. In our experience, our Christ should always be getting better and better. For this we should all know Christ in the way He desires to be known: as the present Christ in His move and economy.

##### [Message Five: Obtaining the Present Christ with His Presence Corporately](https://www.asweetsavor.org/obtaining-the-present-christ-with-his-presence-corporately/)
