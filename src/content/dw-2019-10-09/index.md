_Therefore I have sent \[Epaphroditus\] all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you - Philippians 2:28_

It is easy to understand why the Philippians would rejoice at the return of Epaphroditus in good health, but it is more difficult to understand why Paul would only be less concerned. Why would he not rejoice as well? My feeling is that this episode with Epaphroditus gave him such sorrow that he was not able to fully recover.

While Epaphroditus was so sick, sorrow possessed Paul’s whole being. Although Paul told the Philippians to “rejoice in the Lord always” (Phil. 4:4), he himself was sorrowful and testified that if God had not been merciful, he would have had sorrow upon sorrow. He had watched as Epaphroditus was consumed with sickness, even drawing near to death. Once he recovered, Paul sent him back to the Philippians so they could rejoice. Paul loved Epaphroditus, and that experience filled his heart with so much grief that he could not quickly recover.
