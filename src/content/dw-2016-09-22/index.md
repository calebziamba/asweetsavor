_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._ _— Philippians 2:5–7_

The clause “have this attitude in yourselves” in verse 5 is translated “let this mind be in you” in the King James Version and in Darby’s New Translation. So Paul began this section by describing the mind of Christ.

Who is this Christ? He is the One “who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped” (v. 6). Oh, what a great statement concerning Christ! Christ’s existence equaled God’s existence. From eternity past, His form was that of God. Intrinsically, essentially, and substantially, He was God. Our Savior existed in the form of God from eternity past.
