_So the women sang as they danced, and said:_

_“Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.”_

_Then Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed only thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?” So Saul eyed David from that day forward. — First Samuel 18:7-9_ Saul made David his personal musician, and eventually, the leader of his armies. David became known as a great warrior, and the women began to sing about his many victories (1 Sam. 18:7). The long rows of colorfully-dressed women dancing, playing tambourines, and singing in this way must have really been something to watch. But their boasting in David caused Saul to feel his throne was being threatened.

Therefore, as David played his harp to soothe him, Saul threw his spear at him, thinking to kill him by pinning him to the wall! He actually tried this twice (v. 11). He knew the Lord was with David, yet he sought to kill him to protect his throne. His jealousy was prompted by the women’s admiration and promotion of David above himself.
