_“But now your kingdom shall not continue. The Lord has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the Lord has commanded him to be commander over His people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you.” — First Samuel 13:14._

The main thing we must see is that Saul did not involve God at all in his decision. Therefore, Saul acted religiously. God wanted to lead Saul in his decisions, to be with him as he carried them out, and to be present in the results. Instead, Saul just did what he thought he was supposed to do. This is religion: doing everything we think God wants us to do, yet God Himself not being involved.
