_\[You are\] being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts._ _– 2 Corinthians 3:3_

The longer we follow the Lord, the more time He has to write on us. However, it is possible for us to have been born again for a long time and yet have very little of the Lord’s writing in our hearts. Yes, we are letters of Christ, but we must still allow the Lord to write on us.
