_“Rightly do they love you.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:4_

There are so many workers and so few lovers in the church! We like to compare ourselves with others: “Which of us is more manifested? Who is the leading one?” It is a fallen situation when we become mere workers.

We are so focused on our work that we train others to work rather than help them to love the Lord. It seems that we can tolerate people not being in the Lords’ presence but not the collapse of our work. Our focus is on the work more than on the saints’ love relationship with the Lord. The Song of Songs shows us that anything besides loving the Lord is unnecessary. Real service comes out of our love to Him. May the Lord raise up more lovers in the church, those who are only for Him!
