_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

The difference between slaves and non-slaves is not a matter of possessions. Those who serve the Lord are not exempt from a normal human living. People in the world have families, houses, and cars; so do the Lord’s slaves. However, their whole life is according to Christ. Rather than being oppressed, they are joyful. The Lord’s bond-servants can say to people in the world, “What makes us different from you is not what we own but that we have no freedom. You can do what you want, but we cannot. The Lord Himself decides how we live and what we do. We are slaves of Christ, and that is why we are so happy!”
