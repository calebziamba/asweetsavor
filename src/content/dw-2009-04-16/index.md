_But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved.__) — Ephesians 2:4-5_

Formerly we were under Satan's authority: “And you, though dead in your offenses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience” (Eph. 2:1-2). We were set free from Satan's power and authority by being made alive (Eph. 2:4-5). By being born again we entered into God's kingdom, where we are free from Satan's authority. We have therefore been set free from five negative things: sin, death, the world, the flesh, and the authority of Satan.
