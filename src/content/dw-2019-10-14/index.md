_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

Although Epaphroditus was a common brother, the apostle Paul regarded him very highly. Paul referred to him as his brother, his fellow worker, his fellow soldier, and the Philippians’ messenger and minister to his need (Phil. 2:25). This simple brother became a minister to the needs of a great apostle.

There is a long road down which we must travel before we can become such ministers. As soon as some are saved, they want to take a shortcut and immediately become ministers. However, we should consider the sequence of Paul’s description of Epaphroditus. He was a brother first, before he could become a fellow worker. Then, as a fellow worker he became a fellow soldier. It was as a fellow soldier that he became the messenger of a local church. It was only because he was a brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and messenger that he was able to become a minister. This route is the way for those who are not necessarily that gifted or manifested to eventually become ministers like Epaphroditus.
