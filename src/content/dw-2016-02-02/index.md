_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... â€”Philippians 2:1_

We have to be with others according to who they are. If they are poor, we should be happy to eat with them just as they eat. This is affection. Those whom we are with should sense that we are one with them. Without such a heart, there is no way to minister encouragement or consolation.
