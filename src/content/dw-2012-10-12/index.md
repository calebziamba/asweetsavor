_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

As a seed, we must be hidden, which means that we must be buried. If we want to serve the Lord effectively, He will tell us, “I was a grain of wheat. I buried Myself and died. Eventually, I bore much fruit. A servant is not greater than his master. Do you want to serve Me? Then the path I took is the path you must take. The way I followed the Father is the way that you must follow Me.” This is the first secret of serving the Lord with an effective operation.

We must learn to say, “I am a seed. I am hidden. I am ready to be buried underground. No one will see me. No one will even know me. I am just a seed.” This is a secret which we all must learn.
