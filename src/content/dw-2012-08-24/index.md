_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

From this point onward, if we want God to bless us, we need to pay the price. If we want God to bless our marriage, we need to pay the price. If we want God to bless our family, we need to pay the price. If we want God to bless our job or our spiritual work, we need to pay the price.

We must pay a price to buy the fragrant spices from the Merchant. In this way we will manifest the aroma of Christ’s death and resurrection; we will bear a fragrance. Only when we pay the price to be perfumed by the Lord can we really supply others.
