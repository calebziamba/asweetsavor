_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the edge of his garments. — Psalm 133:1-2_

The ointment that was poured upon Aaron’s head ran down to his beard. In the Bible the beard signifies maturity, because a young man cannot grow a beard until he becomes mature. For the ointment to run down upon the beard signifies that we who are in oneness not only possess Christ’s headship and person, but also His maturity.

Furthermore, this is not just any beard, but “Aaron’s beard.” Aaron was the high priest. “Aaron’s beard” represents the maturity of a priestly serving life. A mature priest is one who brings God to man and man to God. This should be our serving life. We must have the headship, the person, the maturity, and the serving life of Christ.

Aaron’s beard represents a mature exercise in the priestly serving life. When all of the saints are exercised in such a way the church life becomes a corporate serving life. In such a condition we have the oneness which brings in the divine anointing.
