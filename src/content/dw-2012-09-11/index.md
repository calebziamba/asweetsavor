_Go forth, O daughters of Zion, And behold king Solomon with the crown Wherewith his mother crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart. — Song of Songs 3:11_

Here all the overcomers go forth to look at King Solomon with the crown. What is the crown with which Solomon’s mother crowned him on the day of his espousals? This crown refers to the Shulammite herself. Whoever loves the Lord will be His crown. Those who are engaged to the Lord are His boast, and they become His crown.
