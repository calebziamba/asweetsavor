> King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do." Agrippa replied to Paul, “In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian.” And Paul _said_, “I would wish to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains.”

> \- Acts 26:27-29

You must realize, according to the Word, the apostle Paul was a proper model for us to see. You look at this man, you begin to realize, “Wow, the spiritual things are not like what we think.” Even jail cannot control him.
