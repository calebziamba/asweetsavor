> I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 12:1 (NKJV)

Your growth in life is very much related to having vision after vision after vision, and in every vision, revelation after revelation. So the pursuit and growth of a Christian life is a matter of visions.

Excerpted fromÂ _[Visions & Revelations, Volume One](https://www.asweetsavor.org/visions-and-revelations/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 7
