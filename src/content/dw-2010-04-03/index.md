_Jehovah is righteous; He has cut the cords of the wicked. May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned back. May they be like grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up, with which the reaper does not fill his hand, or he who binds sheaves, his bosom. Nor may those who pass by say, “The blessing of Jehovah be upon you! We bless you in the name of Jehovah.” — Psalm 129:4-8_

This section of Psalm 129 is related to the plowing and the producing of furrows for growth. This is a description of those who do not cooperate with the Lord’s hand. Unless we allow the Lord to plow us, eventually we will wither without any growth. We will be fruitless in our experience.

If we do not learn to receive the Lord’s plowing work, then nothing of life can come out of us. Regardless of our talent, capability, or potential, we will be unable to render blessing to the church. May we all learn this lesson, especially those of us who are young. May we allow the Lord to plow us so that we can become a blessing to the church.
