_"On my bed night after night I sought him Whom my soul loves; I sought him but did not find him. I must arise now and go about the city." — Song of Songs 3:1-2_

Oh, brothers and sisters, it is a serious matter if the Lord calls us to follow Him, yet we refuse. We cannot take the matter of the Lord’s calling lightly. If the Lord calls us to join with Him on the pathway of His cross, if He calls us to unite with Him in His suffering or His being put to shame, we have to obey. He wants to see our countenance. Otherwise, He will remove His presence from us.

No matter how we confess our sins or how we deal with the Lord, until we obey, He will not answer. He will only ask, “Are you really following Me?” Once we obey Him, the problem is solved. When we follow Him, then we will immediately have the Lord’s presence again.
