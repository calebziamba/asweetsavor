_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

Many who serve the church are constantly looking for zealous members whom they can bring into church service. Many of these may be young Christians without much experience of the Lord. These young ones only learn how to work, take attendance, and stir people up. They remain short of the Lord’s appearing.
