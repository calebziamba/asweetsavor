_This series covers Brother Titus Chu’s recent speaking in various conferences and trainings. This set of excerpts is from a series of messages given during the 2019-2020 Winter Vision Week training. The content presented below is based on notes taken during the meetings._

Eventually, the land Lot chose to live in (Sodom) was captured in a battle against four kings. Abram fought and defeated Sodom’s captors. Yet, he would not take a single object from the king of Sodom. We should learn to recognize who we gained our spiritual riches from. Yet, in the end, who gave us growth? Only God gave the growth. Abram didn’t want anyone to be able to say that they made him wealthy. Abram wanted to be able to say, “My riches come only from God.” It is only _God_ who gives us spiritual understanding. It is only _God_ who brings us to a state where we can satisfy Him. We should learn to be thankful for all the ones whose books we have gotten help from. If we view each book as a treasure, they can really affect our spiritual life. But we must say: “It is God who has made me rich.”

In our Christian life, we need to be enlarged, we need to be burdened, we need to walk the land, and we need to be enriched. We should be thankful for the ones we have been helped by. Yet, we should know—everything we have is from the Lord. We should learn to say, “It is God who has made me rich.” Christ becomes our reward.

Abraham’s journey had three steps: (1) Coming out, (2) Possessing a land, (3) Begetting descendants. Having a land is the first step in your establishment. Abraham could promise Lot everything, because he knows the land is God’s and the land is his. How could Abram rescue Lot after Lot took advantage of him? Because the land belonged to _him_. You think so much, plan so much, consider so much, dream so much, and even say, “I will follow,” and “Lord, I give You everything.” Yet you are not trustworthy. One good offer from the world can buy you. One good grade in school can buy you. You have no land.

The Lord called you out. You came out of sin and the world, and came to the good land, even consecrating yourselves. But, in that consecration, can you be trusted? Do you have land? How many decisions do you make according to your environment and not according to Christ? How many decisions do you make in the name of the Lord but without Christ? I tell you that I don’t know where you will end up. But when you have a land, your life is very settled. You are solid. You can say, “I know what I’m for. I know what my life is for. I have a piece of land to back me up.” When you have the land, only then can you bear children. Without the land, Abram only had Lot, who was not his real son. How do we know whether or not we have land? Look at the decisions you make. When you have land, you don’t make decisions based on the outward condition. Every decision you make is according to what you have, according to the top interest of God. Every decision you make is with God’s testimony in view. Like a father does for his children, you will pay every price just for the Lord’s satisfaction. This is the character of someone with a solid piece of land.   

Abram had a far fewer number to fight with than the kings who captured Lot. He was afraid. But, he knew he couldn’t turn back. The land was his. He still had to walk through the land, live in the land, possess the land. Are you afraid? Being afraid is a good thing. Despite Abram’s fear, he knew he must fight for this land. You don’t have fear like Abram had; rather you have anxiety. When you fear for your position in a company, when you can’t get results in your lab, you are anxious. You live by anxiety. But once you say, “I am for God,” you will begin to have a piece of land. After all this, God told Abram, “be not afraid.” You should never be afraid of following the Lord. But you should be afraid of living without reality.
