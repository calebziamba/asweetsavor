_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

Once someone has even a little manifestation or spiritual understanding, ambition can rise up. It often takes the guise of seeking to become more useful or fruitful. Such motives could be pure, but they could also be for the advancement of self. It is right for us to develop, grow, and learn to be effective in service. However, it doesn’t take much to cross over into self-ambition, because appreciation and recognition from others feeds the self.
