_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going._ _– Hebrews 11:8_

We will have nothing to boast in when we see the Lord. We will only be able to say, “O God, I don’t even know why I walked this way. I don’t know how You conformed me to Your image so I can stand here.”

If God has mercy on us and we are caught up with the overcomers, we will be surprised that we are counted worthy to be among them. This is the attitude of those who know themselves before God and are walking the way of faith.
