_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

There are three crucial items we can draw from this verse. First, when we follow the Lord, we should be spiritual children with spiritual fathers. Second, we should serve with our spiritual fathers. Third, our service should be in the gospel.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 159.
