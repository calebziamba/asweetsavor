_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?”_

_“My beloved extended his hand through the opening,_ _And my feelings were aroused for him.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:3-4_

When the Lord calls us at this stage, He reveals to us His hand. It may be during a time of prayer or fellowship or during a time of dealing before the Lord. We don’t quite understand how it happens, but the love of the Lord encourages us to pursue Him again by His hand bearing the mark of the nail. His scars and His lowliness in suffering appear to us again.
