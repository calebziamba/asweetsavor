_“How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!_ _How much better is your love than wine,_ _And the fragrance of your oils Than all kinds of spices!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:10_

A good meeting is an enjoyment to the Lord. A good work is also an enjoyment to the Lord. However, these are not the Lord’s desire. The Lord wants us to be sanctified and overcoming, but neither of these are His primary desire.

What the Lord truly desires is our unceasing love toward Him. No matter how blessed we are, no matter how approved we are, no matter how many experiences we have, we still need to tell the Lord, “Oh Lord, I love You. I love You in all my labor. I serve You because I love You. Why do I go the meetings? It is because I love You.”
