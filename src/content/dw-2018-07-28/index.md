Our spiritual growth moves from an outward need to an inward need, which, in being met, corresponds to an outward manifestation. Romans 8:19 says,

_“For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.”_

This shows that the divine life within us must grow into an outward testimony. When our growth finally reaches the stage of glorification, all of creation will be set free to enjoy the freedom of the glory of the children of God (v. 21).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 14.
