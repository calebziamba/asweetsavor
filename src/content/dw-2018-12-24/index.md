_Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev. Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening._ _– Genesis 24:62–63_

Isaac was living in the land of Canaan—the Negev was a pasture land in the southern part of Canaan. It was a good land since it was a land

_“...of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills; a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey; a land where you will eat food without scarcity, in which you will not lack anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper.”_ _– Deuteronomy 8:7–9_

All of this was in the land of Canaan where Isaac dwelt. When we are saved, God brings us into Christ as our good land to experience Him in all these aspects.
