Among all the books of the Bible, the Song of Songs is the unique book that focuses on how we can experience Christ as our life and grow in our relationship with Him. It is so fitting that such a book is a love story between a young maiden and her beloved—a beloved who is also her king—for our relationship with the Lord Jesus ultimately is one of love. It seems that the seeker in the Song of Songs has no life apart from her beloved–no job, no schooling, no family, no hobbies; her only career is to seek to know and to love her king, and to become fully one with him. What a picture of how we should love and pursue our Lord today!
