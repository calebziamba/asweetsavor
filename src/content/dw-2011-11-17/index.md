_“He brought me to his banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:4_

_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

The second section begins with the calling of the Lord (2:8-10). It is a call for deliverance from the self.

The Lord seems to tell her, “You need to be released from caring about your feeling, your enjoyment, your expectation of My presence, and even your joyful state with the brothers and sisters. From now on, I am going to build you up. I am going to work on you so that you can grow, mature, and stand up before Me. I have a request for you now. I want you to shift your center from your feeling to My desire. You do not exist for your own nourishment and satisfaction, nor do others exist for your care and blessing. You and I must be united in feeling, labor, and purpose. You have to become one with Me.” Brothers and sisters, this brings in a big change to our Christian life.

In our spiritual experience, we cannot depart from two foundations. The first foundation we must have is a complete enjoyment of the Lord. The second foundation we must have is a complete union with Him. In the first stage of our Christian life we enjoy the Lord and His riches. In the second stage we become joined to Him and His purpose
