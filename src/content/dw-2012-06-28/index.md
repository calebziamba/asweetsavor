_For You are my rock and my fortress; For Your name's sake You will lead me and guide me. You will pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me, For You are my strength. Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have ransomed me, O Lord, God of truth. — Psalm 31:3-5_ David and his men went up from Maon and dwelt in strongholds at En Gedi (1 Sam. 23:1). The name “En Gedi” means “the fountain of the kid” (Strong).

The psalms David wrote during this period indicate how much he appreciated the Lord as his Savior and recognized his own unworthiness (e.g., Psa. 31). To David, the Lord was like a pure lamb, whereas he himself was an ugly goat. David’s psalms from this period reveal that he depended on the Lord for his daily salvation (e.g., Psa. 17:7; 54:1; 57:1). This Lord could not be defeated. David’s enemy was powerful, but there was no reason to be afraid, for he had such a Savior.
