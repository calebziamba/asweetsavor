_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’" – Acts 7:2-3_

This was God’s first call to Abraham, and it was the first vision Abraham received. When he left Ur, Abraham didn’t know where he was going or what the future held, but he knew he had met God. Although he didn’t know the way to the land God had spoken of, because of his vision he was clear that he would follow the God who had appeared to him. Abraham never left this initial vision, and this is the second item in the principle to gain God.
