_“Now it is true that I am a close relative; however, there is a kinsman closer than I. Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the Lord lives. Lie down until the morning.” — Ruth 3:12-13_

The question now is this: Who does this nearest kinsman represent? Boaz clearly represents Christ, and Ruth represents us. Therefore, it must be significant that, though Ruth’s desire is toward Boaz and she has given herself to him, there is a kinsman more closely related to her than Boaz.

This nearest relative has the right to declare possession over Ruth. If this is so, how can she offer herself to Boaz at all? In our experience, this closer kinsman is our natural man. If our natural man is our closest kinsman and has the first right of ownership over us, how can we ever be released so that we might be joined to Christ? This kinsman has to be dealt with before we can fully enter into the union we desire with the Lord.
