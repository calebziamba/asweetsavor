_“For your love is better than wine.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2_

The beginning of this book is so good: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!” But it is not followed by, “For you yourself are better than wine.” Instead it is followed by,  
“For your love is better than wine.” This is because, at this stage, we are not yet touching the Lord Himself; we are only touching His love.

When we are weak and ask for forgiveness, the Lord tells us, “I love you; I forgive you.” Since we have a very limited capacity at this point, the Lord can only allow us to touch His love. We still do not know how rich He is. At this stage, we have yet to discover the riches of His person.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, pages 21-22.
