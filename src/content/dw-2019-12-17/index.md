_“Your eyes are like doves.”  
– Song of Songs 1:15  
  
_

To say that we have “eyes like doves” refers to both our spiritual insight and our purity. It means that we are pure, for the eyes of a dove can only see one thing at a time; in the same way, we can only see the Lord. Moreover, one who is pure has spiritual insight, and one with spiritual insight finds it easier to be pure.

The first thing the Lord mentions in His praise of His seeker is that her eyes are like doves. Earlier, she pastured the young goats, so she was very busy. However, even then her eyes could only see the Lord; she could not see the Lord and her work at the same time. Thus, she simply followed the Lord according to her spiritual sight, rather than the outward situation.
