_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

If we still consider ourselves capable, we don’t know ourselves. When we feel a little weak, we might pray, “Lord, strengthen me to do Your will.” Abraham was not like this. He didn’t ask the Lord to strengthen his body. He just laughed at himself, thinking, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?” (Gen. 17:17). He wouldn’t dare to accuse God of making fun of him. He didn’t have the assurance to say, “God, You will fulfill what You have spoken.” Neither could he say, “I am going to leave You. Please don’t trouble me anymore.” He only said, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” (v. 18). How conflicted Abraham was!
