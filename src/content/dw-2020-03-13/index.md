_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,  
set apart for the gospel of God Which He promised beforehand  
through His prophets in the holy Scriptures"  
\-Romans 1:1-2  
_

The Old Testament is full of gospel messages that contain the promise of Christ.

In Abraham’s age, God revealed the gospel in many ways. He promised that Abraham would have a seed. This “seed” was singular, referring to Christ (Gen. 3:15; Gal. 3:16), who is the gospel. When God spoke to Abraham, saying, “I will make you a great nation” (Gen. 12:2), this “nation” was another revealing of the gospel to Abraham. When God again said, “Indeed I will greatly bless  you” (22:17), the “blessing” was another reference to Christ. God told Abraham, “I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies” (22:17). These descendants of Abraham are a race that comes from Christ, the Seed. This was the gospel promised during Abraham’s time.
