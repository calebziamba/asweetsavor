_“Your neck is lovely with strings of jewels.” — Song of Songs 1:10b_ “Neck” represents our ability to obey. In the Old Testament, God often said that the Israelites were a stiff-necked people. No one who is just beginning to love the Lord feels that he needs to obey. Instead, when we are just beginning to love the Lord, we have opinions inwardly while outwardly we put on a string of jewels, making our necks appear beautiful, and seem to be subservient. As a matter of fact our submission is not real, and if we were asked to obey, we could not. We still lack the capacity to understand the price our obedience would require.
