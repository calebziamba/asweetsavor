_"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord...."  
\- Philippians 3:1  
_

\[A\] living of laying hold of Christ is manifested in our rejoicing. This is why Paul began this chapter with a charge to rejoice. Rejoicing should be our hallmark as Christians.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 178.
