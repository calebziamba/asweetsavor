_"The king has brought me into his chambers." — Song of Songs 1:4b_

_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste. He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:3-4_

Why is it some people cannot believe in Jesus? It is because they don’t trust His love. Why is it some believers can no longer go on? It is also due to the fact that they do not trust His love. Why do we sometimes balk at following the Lord, or only follow Him grudgingly? It is because we do not trust the love of the Lord. Although we believe in Him, we don’t have faith that it is His love that measures everything to us. Therefore, we feel we could do better by acting in our own self-interest.
