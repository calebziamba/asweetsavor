_"It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance,  
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,  
among whom I am foremost of all."  
\- 1 Timothy 1:15  
_

Even if we would tell the Lord, “I am the foremost of sinners,” we don’t actually hate or despise ourselves. We love ourselves too much to stand with God in condemning this “foremost of sinners. One day the Lord will come to meet us and thoroughly enlighten us. It may be when we have used up all our natural ability or when the environment is so difficult that we feel we can do nothing but come to the Lord.
