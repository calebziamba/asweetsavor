_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

We should be moved when we read the phrase “crooked and perverse generation.” Look at all mankind today. So many precious individuals have been thwarted from reaching God’s goal and have become ruined in relation to the purpose God had for them.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ,](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; pages 125-126.
