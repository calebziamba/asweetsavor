_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _— First Corinthians 3:6_

Paul recommended Apollos to the Corinthians even though Apollos had been helped by Priscilla and Aquila, Paul’s spiritual children (1 Cor. 16:12; Acts 18:24–26, 1–3). Though Apollos was Paul’s spiritual grandson, Paul could say, “I planted, Apollos watered” (1 Cor. 3:6). He recognized that God worked through all the gifted members.
