_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

To “work out” does not imply that we produce our own salvation. It means we must complete it. The Lord has already redeemed us and regenerated us. Now He is providing us the environment necessary for the working out of our salvation.

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ,”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 115.
