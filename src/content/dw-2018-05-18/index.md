_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

The fact that the gospel of God is centered on Jesus Christ is so good, because people always want everything other than Christ Himself. For example, many brothers love the Lord. However, what they ultimately want is to know the truth, to be powerful, to be able to speak well, to supply life, and to build the church. Many sisters also love the Lord, however, they ultimately desire meekness, kindness, diligence, and fruitfulness. The Bible shows us that the Corinthians wanted tongue speaking and other gifts, the Galatians wanted the Law and traditions, and the Colossians wanted philosophy and the elements of the world. It seems that people, even those who love the Lord, desire everything other than Christ.
