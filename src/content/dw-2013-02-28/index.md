_“You are a garden spring,_ _A well of living water,_ _And streams flowing from Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:15_

Because we are one with the Lord for His purpose, we become those who are in His heart; His heart is upon us. As a result, we become a garden enclosed, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed just for the Lord’s enjoyment. We have become full of the Lord’s riches, which are like honey and milk flowing from us to revive and nourish those around us.
