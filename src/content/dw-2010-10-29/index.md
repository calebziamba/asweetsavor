_O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; Nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me. — Psalm 131:1_

When the Lord comes to work on us and shines His light upon us, then our eyes look down. We no longer think that we are so important. We no longer think of ourselves as a vine tree, or as a mighty man with arrows, or as a great servant of the Lord, as in Psalm 128. Instead, we walk with lowliness and humility. We realize that we are on the same level as all the other dear saints. We no longer measure ourselves against them because we are the same as they are. Then we can testify to the Lord, “I have nothing to be proud of. I am not higher than anyone. I am just one of the brothers. My heart is not proud, and my eyes are not haughty. Lord, I am here by Your mercy.”
