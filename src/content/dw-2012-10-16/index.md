"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

When a person first gets saved and begins to love the Lord, he may have no idea what it means to be an apostle, or a prophet, or an evangelist. These things are very distant, and he doesn’t know how he will eventually be manifested.

Nonetheless, every day he enjoys Christ. Every day he has the Lord’s presence. Every day he tries to spend time before the Lord. Every day he can say that he has life, and that he even has life abundantly.
