_For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? — First Corinthians 2:11a

The spiritual man discerns all things, but he himself is discerned by no one. — First Corinthians 2:15_

A person who is spiritually keen and aware is always seeking to live in the Lord’s presence. He is continuously watching in spirit, and ready for anything. When someone speaks, he is inwardly clear about where they are at. He is not easily caught, persuaded, or led away to other things. He exercises himself to see what God is doing.
