_This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you._ _â€“ John 15:12_

We should love one another as Christ first loved us. We must be careful, however, that our love is genuine. Our love should not be a natural love, one that involves self-interest.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 99.
