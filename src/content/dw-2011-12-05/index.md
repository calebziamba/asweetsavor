_So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants. — First Samuel 18:5_

Having been chosen, anointed, trained, tested, and approved, David was greatly appreciated by Saul. David became exceptionally manifest among God’s people. His victories in battle won him public praise. Once the king’s armorbearer, David now ranked among the few men who sat with Saul, and he became the king’s son-in-law by marrying his daughter, Michal. Even though David was still a young man, Saul set him over the men of war (1 Sam. 18:5). David behaved wisely and had the presence of the Lord (v. 14). He was surely held in high regard and appreciated by everyone.
