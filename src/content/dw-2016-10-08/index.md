_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

When people become bond-servants, someone else determines what they must do, when they will eat or sleep, what money they may hold, and whom they will marry. Their future and fate lie in their masters’ hands. When the Lord became a man, He took the form of a bond-servant. He became a man totally under God’s hand. Inwardly He was still God, but in form He went from the highest place to the lowest.
