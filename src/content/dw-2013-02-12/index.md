_“How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!_ _How much better is your love than wine,_ _And the fragrance of your oils Than all kinds of spices!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:10_

_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is_ _For brothers to dwell together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head,_ _Coming down upon the beard,_ _Even Aaron’s beard,_ _Coming down upon the edge of his robes_ _— Psa 133:1-2_ 

No longer is the Lord the only one who has a pleasant fragrance; now we also are full of fragrance. Not only the Lord has the Holy Spirit, but we also possess the Holy Spirit.

The ointment upon the head of “Aaron” (representing Christ in Psalm 133) also comes to us, His Body. Since the Lord as the compound Spirit has worked in us, we have a pleasant fragrance. The life flowing from us can supply and satisfy people wherever we go.
