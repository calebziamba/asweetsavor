_Now you are the Body of Christ, and members individually. — First Corinthians 12:27

Obey the ones leading you and submit to them, for they watch over your souls as those who will render an account, that they may do this with joy and not groaning; for this would be unprofitable to you. — Hebrews 13:17_

In your body, each member's function is so much in life. It is really an organism, yet it is most organized. It is organized according to life and function, not according to maneuvering.

When the elders take a direction in the church life, and you have the thought of democracy, you may get frustrated by their decision. But if you realize how hateful democracy is to the church life and to the heading up, you will be much more restful.
