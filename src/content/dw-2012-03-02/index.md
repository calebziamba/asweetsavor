_Now it came about, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. — First Samuel 23:6_

It might have seemed good to David to remain in the cave in that state of repentance and reflection, all the while forming those who came to him into a fighting force. However, news came that the town of Keilah was under attack by the Philistines. David asked the Lord whether he should attack the marauding Philistines, and the Lord said to go up and deliver the town. Therefore, David and his men fought the Philistines and saved the inhabitants of the town, taking away the Philistines’ livestock (1 Sam. 23:1–5).

At this point, Abiathar, the only priest who escaped Saul’s slaughter of the priests at Nob, arrived (1 Sam. 23:6). What a blessing this was, for now there was a king and a priest who were able to serve together!
