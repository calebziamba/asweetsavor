_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _â€” Romans 1:1-3_

Redemption is objective to us; it is a fact already accomplished by Christ. However, salvation must be subjective; it is our lifelong experience.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 10.
