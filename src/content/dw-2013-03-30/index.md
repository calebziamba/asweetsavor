_“Why have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.” – Second Samuel 12:9_

_Have mercy upon me, O God,_ _according to Your lovingkindness;_ _According to the multitude of Your tender mercies,_ _blot out my transgressions._ _– Psalm 51:1_

David’s repentance is found in Psalm 51, which shows David realized how much he needed the Lord’s mercy in abundance. In verse 5, he says he was a sinner from his mother’s womb. David expressed his fear as he cried, “Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me” (v. 11). What he had done was dreadful; he realized it would not suffice simply to offer the Lord some sacrifice. In spite of his unworthiness, David requested, “Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem” (v. 18).

It seems David was saying, “Though I have failed, don’t allow Your testimony to fail. In spite of me, do good to Zion.” His desire was still for the fulfillment of God’s desire. I feel that by the time he finished writing this psalm, many of his sins had been cleared up.
