_And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will...._

_Now David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption. — Acts 13:22, 36_

These are the two things we all should care about above everything else—our relationship with God and how we serve our generation. We should serve our generation according to God’s heart. We should not merely care for our own things. Too many people either serve only themselves or serve their generation in a way that is not according to God’s heart. Most people have their own plans and seek what is to their own benefit. Shouldn’t we consider our livelihood? Yes, we should. Yet David gave himself to live for what God desired and trusted that God was able to take care of him.

Today God is still looking for those who care about what He is seeking. As we serve our generation, God is looking to see if we care for what is on His heart. These two matters should regulate our lives.
