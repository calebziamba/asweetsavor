> He hath brought me to the house of wine,  
> And his banner over me is love
> 
> – Song of Songs 2:4 (DARBY)

A normal church is a banqueting house, a “house of wine.” It is the place where you can be satisfied and even be drunk in spirit. In this house of wine, all the saints can enjoy the Lord together. It is the place where the saints are lost in the presence of the Lord, a place that every believer treasures. In the church life there should be no toiling or sighing, but only the experience of satisfaction and joy that comes from drinking the heavenly wine.
