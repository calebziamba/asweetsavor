In experience, resurrection involves strengthening power, enlivening power, ascending power, and even governing power. This same power seated Christ on the throne in the heavenly places (Eph. 1:19–21). By this power, every need of our Christian lives can be fulfilled. This power became ours the day we believed and received Jesus as our Savior.
