_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

_Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb._ _– Romans 4:19_

The reality of faith is not, “I know God can do it,” nor, “Hallelujah, I am walking the way of the Lord.” The reality of faith is the result of God working on us to the point that we, like Abraham, consider ourselves as good as dead (Rom. 4:19).
