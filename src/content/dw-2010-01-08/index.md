_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine. Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; Your name is like ointment poured forth; Therefore the virgins love you.” — Song of Songs 1:1-3_

Brothers and sisters, if you serve without touching the Lord, your service may keep you occupied, but you will not know much genuine companionship. Once you touch the Lord, however, you will find out that there are so many good brothers and sisters in the church, and you will appreciate these virgins.

Before, although you had friends, there was no building up, and you were lonely. When you had only friends, you would get together when something you had in common interested you, but when the common interest disappeared, you went your separate ways. However, when you found the virgins, you found real fellowship. You discovered that there were so many following the Lord and loving the Lord beside you. You should not enjoy the wine of the Lord’s love by yourself, but together with the other virgins.
