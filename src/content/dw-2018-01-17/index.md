_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

Do we follow Christ because we have studied and considered thoroughly until we are clear? No. It is because the Holy Spirit reveals the Lord to us, and we are attracted by His preciousness. We don’t know why and where we will go. We don’t know what kind of glory we will have. Yet somehow we are so attracted, and we just want to follow Him.
