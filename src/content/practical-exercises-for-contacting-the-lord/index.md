This is Message Two of the [Jesus Lovers' Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/) held January 16-18, 2009

In this message we are given some very practical exercises for us to contact the Lord, so that we may learn to abide in Him. There are four basic lines: prayer, the Word, using the hymns, and our personal exercise before the Lord.
