_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

We cannot have one foot in and one foot out. A man who sees the woman he desires to marry takes a very clear stand: “I must marry that woman!” He does not go to her and say, “Don’t feel pressured; I have four other possibilities lined up if you don’t agree.” No, his stand is very clear. It should be the same with us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 132.
