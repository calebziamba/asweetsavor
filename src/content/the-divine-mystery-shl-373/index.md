1. Oh! Let us sing joyfully.  
    Sing an unveiled mystery  
    We enjoy the realm of the Spirit now  
    The divine and mystical reality.  
    Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice!  
    This divine mystery!  
    We enjoy the realm of the Spirit now  
    The divine and mystical reality.
2. Oh! You are the Spirit, Lord,  
    in my spirit one with me.  
    When I touch the life-giving Spirit now  
    I am one with You and You are one with me.  
    Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice!  
    in the Spirit of life.  
    When I touch the life-giving Spirit now  
    I am one with You and You are one with me.
3. Oh! I'm saved organically,  
    growing to maturity.  
    Now from sin, the world, and the self I'm free  
    In the Spirit who is sanctifying me.  
    Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice  
    Sanctify thoroughly;  
    Now from sin, the world and the self I'm free  
    In the Spirit who is sanctifying me.
4. Oh! In spirit we're transformed,  
    to the Son we are conformed.  
    He's the resurrected, surpassing One;  
    Who is formed and constituted within me.  
    Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice!  
    To the Son we're conformed.  
    He's the resurrected, surpassing One;  
    Who is formed and constituted within me.
5. I'm becoming one with Him,  
    And His glory shines within.  
    From a vessel rough, comes a life refined,  
    And His life is shining out for all to see  
    Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice!  
    Oh this life! Glorious!  
    From a vessel rough, comes a life refined,  
    And His life is shining out for all to see.
