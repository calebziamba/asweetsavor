_And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know. â€” First John 2:20_ You cannot say that if a person does not manifest the anointing, he is not spiritual. If he is anointed, however, then he most definitely is spiritual. If he is anointed in his living, in his speaking, in his work for the Lord, and in his relatedness with the saints, he is a spiritual man. An anointed person is one who is able to supply others with life and to build up the church.
