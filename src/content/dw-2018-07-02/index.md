_For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death._ _– Romans 8:2_

In addition to focusing on the matter of salvation, Romans also focuses on the divine life. The reason God’s life is so crucial is because His salvation is related both to the divine life itself and to the growth of this life in us.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 10.
