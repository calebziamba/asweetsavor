When we talk about our spirit, we should realize that the conscience is a part of our spirit. The conscience is also the leading aspect of the heart. The condition of our conscience determines the operation of our soul. If I am a rough person, the problem is my conscience. If I am fallen in sin today, the problem likewise has to do with my conscience. If I am unable to follow the Lord, the problem again has to do with my conscience. Our ability to follow the Lord depends upon how healthy our conscience is.
