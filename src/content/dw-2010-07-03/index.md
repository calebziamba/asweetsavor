_O Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption. He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins. — Psalm 130:7-8_

Praise the Lord for His redemption! The Lord is the one who redeems us from all our corruption and iniquity. Individually and corporately, the Lord redeems us from everything that is not of Himself. The church will be free from all its iniquity because the Lord is the church’s Redeemer.

Psalm 130 is a wonderful psalm. After experiencing what is described in this psalm we truly become enlarged. By our knowledge of ourselves and our trust in the Lord’s redemption we become enlarged for the sake of His testimony.
