_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

In the third stage of the seeker’s experience in the  Song of Songs, the most important experience is that of the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense (4:6), for they indicate a fuller union with the Lord in His death and resurrection.

After passing through the experiences of the first three chapters, a major change takes place. We become more useful in the Lord’s hands, and others also recognize that something precious has been wrought into us. Our prayer in this stage becomes, “Oh, Lord, I allow Your cross to do its complete work in me; I long to live a life completely in Your death and resurrection.”
