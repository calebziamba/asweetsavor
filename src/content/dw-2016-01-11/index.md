_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion...._ _—Philippians 2:1_

Philippians 2 begins with “therefore.” By this simple word, Paul indicated that, based on the previously stated facts of conducting ourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel (1:27–30)—being proper among ourselves, toward the Lord, toward those who oppose, and toward the apostles—there should be encouragement in Christ, consolation of love, fellowship of the Spirit, and affection and compassion. All of these virtues become the basis of our fellowship with one another.
