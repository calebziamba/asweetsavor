Drawing pictures of what the Bible is saying can truly make its words come alive. This book contains 156 pencil drawings of Old Testament prophesies about Christ. Each drawing is labeled with the particular fact about Christ that the prophecy illuminates and the corresponding New Testament verses. Christ is announced in almost every Old Testament book. Jesus Himself, after His resurrection, explained to two disciples the details about Himself that were in Moses, the Psalms and the Prophets. As He was speaking, the disciples' hearts were burning inside them. I hope this book will make your heart burn as well, as you look at the pictures and understand how many details of Christ's marvelous person and work are described in the Old Testament.
