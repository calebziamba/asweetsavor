_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

This father-child relationship is not a matter of formal position but a relationship in life. As children, we should credit our fathers for our growth, spiritual understanding, equipping, and the development of our ability to serve in the church life.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 160.
