_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

_How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard._ _– Hebrews 2:3_

The book of Hebrews tells us that God arranges everything in our environment just for this salvation. Today, we eagerly await Christ, who “will appear a second time for salvation” (9:28). How can we work out anything of our own salvation (Phil. 2:12)? We must understand this to mean the completion of the work of salvation already begun.
