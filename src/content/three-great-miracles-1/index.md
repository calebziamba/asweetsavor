> Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
> 
> \- Genesis 1:26

Out of nothing, God created everything. God declared, “I will make man in our image after our likeness.” Yet, God is God and man is man. God and men are so distant. God is a holy God; God is a righteous God. Men are sinful; men are in a fallen state. The enemy came in and damaged mankind, but God says, “I still would like to fulfill my original desire: I want men to have my likeness outside and to have my image inside. Not to be far away from me, but that I can be in them--that I can be one with them.”
