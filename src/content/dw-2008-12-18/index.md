_Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. —Ruth 2:1_

_For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin._ _—Hebrews 4:1_5

Not only was Boaz a man of wealth, but his name means “In him is strength.” In my fifty years of following the Lord, nothing has been easy. Recently I told my wife, “As I consider these fifty years...,” and I stopped; tears came to my eyes. I had a lot of feeling toward the Lord whom I served. It was as if I were telling Him, “Lord, had I known it would be this hard, I might not have followed You.” My wife was surprised by my tears. She put her arm around me and said, “All is well.”

Why am I still here serving the Lord? I feel that if the Lord would give me twenty more years to live, I would give them all to Him. My desire is that in each remaining year I might be more and more productive, of more value, and more of a blessing to the Body of Christ. Why is this? It is because Christ is my Boaz; in Him is strength. We are limited and fragile people. The Lord would encourage us, knowing that things sometimes are too hard to bear. He reminds us that He is our High Priest who sympathizes with our weaknesses (Heb. 4:15). In Him is strength!
