> For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also **we eagerly wait for a Savior**, the Lord Jesus Christ;
> 
> \- Philippians 3:20

Why would Paul, being so mature, eagerly await Christ as his Savior? It is because he realized how much he needed Christ as his Savior. He was desperate and eager for the Lord to rescue him, for he knew how fallen he was. ... The more we mature, the more we say, “Lord, save me!” Therefore, we “eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ” (v. 20).
