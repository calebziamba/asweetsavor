_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _– Philippians 1:1_

The book of Philippians is one of the fourteen New Testament epistles written by the apostle Paul. These epistles show us the progression of God’s economy, which is His dispensation or administration (Eph. 1:10). Paul’s first epistle, Romans, is an introduction to God’s economy, and his last epistle, Hebrews, is the conclusion to this economy. We are growing now from Romans all the way to Hebrews.
