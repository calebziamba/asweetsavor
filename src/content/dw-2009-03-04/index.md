_Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power._

_For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those in Laodicea, even all who have not seen my face in the flesh.... — Colossians 1:28 - 2:1_

We do not lack brothers who can speak. There are many experienced and manifested brothers who are traveling around giving conferences. When someone begins to travel widely to give messages, he may feel that he is serving the Lord in the topmost manner. Some who are invited to give conferences even become addicted to speaking.

I want you to know that this is not the way to serve the Lord. You should measure your effectiveness by those you have raised up and how many you have given yourself to, not by how many conferences you have given.

The Lord does not desire that you give messages. He desires that through your speaking you might gain people for Him. What matters is not how well you speak, but whether or not people are gained for the Lord through your speaking. If no one is gained through your speaking, your speaking is useless, regardless of how well you speak. The Lord doesn't want your messages. What He wants are people, gained through your prophesying. Therefore, as you prophesy, you must learn to look at people and focus upon them.
