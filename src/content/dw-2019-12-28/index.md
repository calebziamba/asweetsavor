_“I am the rose of Sharon,  
 The lily of the valleys.”  
– Song of Songs 2:1  
_

The rose in this verse is actually a kind of wild lily, which is a common flower of very little value. A lily of the valleys is also ordinary and unassuming, and, of course, it is found in the valleys.

The Lord’s seeker now realizes that she is nothing special or extraordinary. She no longer exalts or glorifies herself or considers herself to be the most useful one, and she no longer thinks that she is the one who loves the Lord the most. Instead, she feels that she is just an ordinary flower, and she even likens herself to a despised flower. There is nothing to brag about. There is nothing to be manifested. She is simply a rose of Sharon and a lily of the valleys, and God is caring for her. 

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 70.
