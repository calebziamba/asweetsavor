_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

When we grumble, we deny the headship of Christ, and when we dispute, we deny His wisdom. We unconsciously assume that we, rather than God, know what is best. This is why grumbling and disputing are so offensive to the Lord. Those who grumble and dispute display a lack of trust in Christ their Lord. Practically speaking, Christ is not their Lord.
