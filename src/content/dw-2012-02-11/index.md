_"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." â€” Song of Songs 2:14_

Brothers and sisters, the Lord is asking you to give your whole person to Him. The Lord wants to lead you into death inwardly and outwardly, and into His resurrection. After you experience union with Christ in His death and resurrection, you will become a person tender, sweet, and lovely both inwardly and outwardly.

When we experience the death and resurrection of the Lord, our voice becomes sweet. We can express something real when our praise to the Lord issues from genuine experience. Our voice becomes sweet and our outward countenance becomes lovely as a result of this inward change.
