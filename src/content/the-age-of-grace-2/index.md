> I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst
> 
> \- John 6:35

The New Testament brings in the all-sufficient supply from God. God is the all-sufficient supply. The all sufficient supply is from God’s redemption and salvation, resulting in the satisfaction of both God and man. In the Old Testament, God says, “I’m here, do this!” In the New Testament, God says, “No, no, no. I’m the grace. I like to be in you. I like to be one with you. I like to abide in you. I like to be growing in you. I eventually like you to testify of me”. Old Testament condemns. New Testament provides life for us to grow in life. This is so marvelous.
