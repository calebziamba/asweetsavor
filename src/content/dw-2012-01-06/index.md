_Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus. Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:12-14_ Paul told the Philippians that he did one thing: he pursued. He sought to lay hold of that for which he also had been laid of by Christ Jesus. In a good sense, this pursuing of Paul was his persecuting of Christ ever since being captured by Christ. The Lord had gained him, and now he was intent upon gaining Christ.

Do you ever pray in such a way to the Lord? “Lord, bless me. Be with me. Carry me on. Lead me. If You do not, I will not let You go until You do!” Or do you pray, “Well, Lord, if You cannot be with me today, that is all right; perhaps tomorrow You can bless me with Your presence—I need a break anyway.” That is not what Christ has gained us for. He has laid hold of us so that we might pursue Him even to the extent that we persecute Him until He fully gains us.
