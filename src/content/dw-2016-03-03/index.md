_The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown._ _– Genesis 6:2, 4_

This mixture of the sons of God (fallen angels, Jude 6–7) with the daughters of men produced the Nephilim, or giants, the mighty men of renown. God hated this mixture.

We Christians often serve both in the spirit as well as in the flesh, using our own ways. This is the principle of mixture. We find it hard to walk solely by the spirit, so we mix the spirit with the flesh. This produces “mighty men of renown.” On the one hand we pray with our spirit, and on the other hand, we are full of plans and try our best to handle things according to the flesh. This is mixture. As a result, we build ourselves up, seeking to become mighty men.
