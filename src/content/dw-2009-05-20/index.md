_Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh. — Second Corinthians 3:3_ We should tell the Lord, “Lord, now I am positioned to be written upon by You.” One day everything the Lord has written on us will be manifested. Some “letters” will be quite short, possibly only a few sentences long. Such a person's Christian life was largely wasted. Almost nothing was written on his heart. Was the person genuinely saved? Yes, and therefore he became a letter of Christ. But was the Lord able to write anything? Only a little.

May the Lord be merciful to us. Every day we should say, “Lord, today I want You to write something on me.” Our experience of the Lord is His writing. If we have experienced the Lord today, that means something has been written on us, and the letter has become a little longer. Every time the Spirit moves within us and we cooperate with Him, that means the Lord is writing upon us. We need to allow the Lord to write on us for our entire life. Otherwise, we will surely regret the many lost opportunities. May we all allow the Lord to write on us so that we become a long and substantial letter of Christ.
