The first commission the Lord gave us as believers is to love one another. He says in John 15:12,

_This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 99.
