_I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching. —2 Timothy 4:1-2_ If we don’t cultivate a broad and open mind while we are still young, we will not be able to build upon Brother Lee’s riches. Without the determination to advance, Brother Lee would not have been able to go beyond the riches of Brother Nee. If we have a narrow mind and say we are wealthy and have need of nothing, no one will be able to advance Brother Lee’s riches. If everyone thinks, “The Bible has been opened up,” or, “We have reached the high peak and cannot go higher,” then no one can go forward or dare to go forward. If this becomes our case, we  unwittingly will bury all the riches the Lord has given to us.
