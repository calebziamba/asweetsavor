_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _â€” Romans 1:1-3_

To speak for the Lord, to raise up a church, and to serve a church are all spiritual things from the Lord. Yet unconsciously, these things can become what we want, exalt, and even worship, rather than Christ Himself. If these things replace Christ and there is no room for Him to work in us, we have fallen into the principle of idol worship.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 9.
