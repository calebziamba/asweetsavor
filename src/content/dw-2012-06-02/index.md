_Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14_ We should have Paul’s aspiration! May we encourage and exhort each other in this way so that all the riches of the Lord may become our reality. Amen!
