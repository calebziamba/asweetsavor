_For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness._ _– Romans 1:18_

Almost immediately in Romans, Paul declares God’s condemnation of humanity. The ungodly are condemned, the self-righteous are condemned, those who judge others are condemned, the outwardly impressive Jews are condemned, and finally, all the people of the world are condemned (Rom. 1:18–3:20). We too were once under condemnation, but God prepared redemption for us, that by the blood of Jesus Christ His Son, we could obtain judicial redemption through faith (3:21–26).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, pages 13-14.
