_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle"  
\-Romans 1:1  
_

Paul was a slave of Christ Jesus. This means that he totally belonged to the Lord, and that his whole life was spent completely for the Lord. His life, his living, his service, and his future were wholly for his Master and his Masterâ€™s benefit. He not only lived for objective knowledge about God, but for a Lord who was very real to Him subjectively. He not only lived for a God based on doctrine, but for a Lord he could enjoy and experience.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 34.
