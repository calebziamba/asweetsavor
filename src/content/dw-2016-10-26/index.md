_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. —Philippians 2:8–11_

Since Christ never sinned but paid the price for sin, why should it be a gracious matter that God gave this name to Him? Hadn’t He earned such a name? It might seem so to us, but to the Lord it was not so. His heart was only focused on one thing: to do the will of God.
