_And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. — Acts 2:42_

If I daily go to a brother’s house to have supper and we also break bread and pray together, surely our life is involved with one another. It is our daily life together that produces the one accord. However, when we are distant from the saints, it is difficult to have one accord.

We may attend a conference and see some saint we have not seen in 20 years. So we exchange greetings, thanking the Lord that we are both still in the recovery, and we consider this to be one accord. But what kind of one accord is this? It is only when we and other saints are in and out of each other’s homes, eating, enjoying, praying, and fellowshipping, that genuine one accord exists. Such togetherness in living produces sweetness and one accord.
