After Paul spent three years in Arabia, he sought fellowship with the disciples in Jerusalem (Gal. 1:17–18; Acts 9:26). At first, however, no one there wanted fellowship with him because they feared him as one who had persecuted the churches. Only Barnabas was willing to receive Paul and introduce him to the apostles, who then extended to him “the right hand of fellowship” (Gal. 2:9).
