_"The king has brought me into his chambers." — Song of Songs 1:4b_

_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste. He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:3-4_

When you first consecrate yourself and experience something of the initial work of the cross, you experience being brought into the King’s chambers and enjoying the Lord’s life. Furthermore, you are brought into the church life and enjoy the riches of the brothers and sisters.

At this time you can say, “Oh, Lord, Your banner over me is love. Your love prevails; it is inexhaustible. It covers me. I have a banner, which is love. Oh, Lord, how dearly do You love me! You loved me from the beginning. Today You still love me. How vast is Your love! How satisfying is Your love! Because You love me, I follow You. Oh, Lord, Your banner over me is love.” At this point you don’t have any problems, for the Lord’s love has solved them all.
