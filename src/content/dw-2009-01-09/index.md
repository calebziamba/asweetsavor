_Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved? — 2 Corinthians 13:5_ We may think that when we were born again the Holy Spirit came into us, but Christ Himself remained outside of us. This is a wrong concept. Because God is Triune, we usually divide Him into God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Yet we often neglect the oneness of the Triune God. When we were born again, who was it that came into our spirit to live within us? We might answer, “The Holy Spirit.” This is certainly true, but we should not separate the Spirit from Christ Himself.

If we say that only the Spirit came into us, but not Christ Himself, then being born again has nothing to do with the person of the living Christ. If we were asked, “Where is the Spirit,” we might say, “The Spirit is inside me as the representative of Christ.” Then if we were asked, “Where is Christ,” we might say, “He is sitting on the throne in the heavens.” But this is not accurate. We must remember that God is Triune. Not only is the Spirit in us, but Christ is also in us. When we were born again, Christ Himself came into us.
