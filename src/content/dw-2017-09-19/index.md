_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

When God calls us, we are too shocked to believe, saying, “God, You must have found the wrong person. How could it possibly be me?” Then we laugh—not merely a joyful laugh but one with a whole spectrum of feelings. Abraham expressed all these feelings when he laughed (Gen. 17:17). On the one hand, he couldn’t leave God. On the other hand, he found His word unbelievable. On the one hand, with God all things are possible. On the other hand, with him all things seemed impossible. His true condition was laid bare before him. He knew he could do nothing and felt completely useless.
