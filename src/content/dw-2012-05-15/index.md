_"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’" Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me." — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

The brothers and sisters who helped the maiden had deeply experienced the Lord. Unlike those with little experience, they possessed the heart and mind of Christ Jesus. Instead of trying to help the seeker in her zeal and outward behavior, they brought her to the Lord and led her to His way. Those lacking experience can only give suggestions, but those in union with the Lord are able to bring others into union with Him.
