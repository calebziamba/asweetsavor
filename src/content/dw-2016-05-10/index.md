_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _â€”Philippians 2:3_

All people like to feel they are valuable. No one is naturally humble. Even though I may not be a good cook, I still comfort myself with the knowledge that I can chop onions. My English may not be that good, but I can point to some ability in math. I can find something that bolsters my pride.
