_“Rightly do they love you.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:4_

If the saints in a church are concerned only for the Lord and for enjoying Him, they love Him rightly. However, often believers do not love the Lord rightly but instead have many conditions to their love.

When a church is short of loving virgins, the saints will have many conditions that must be met before they will submit to the Lord or give themselves to Him. For a church to be healthy, it needs many saints who love the Lord rightly! The more saints there are in a church who love the Lord in this way, the more life and freshness there will be in that church life.
