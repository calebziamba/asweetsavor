> Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:17 NASB

Many times when we follow the example of those with more maturity in Christ, we merely imitate their outward behavior instead of their way of gaining Christ. If we see other believers doing something that the Lord has not measured to us and say, “If they can do that, I can too,” we will get ourselves into trouble. We must be careful when we follow the example of others, for what the Lord allows them is not necessarily something measured to us. To truly become followers of others’ example, we must be inspired by their person, life, vision, service, and riches. These are the things we should imitate.
