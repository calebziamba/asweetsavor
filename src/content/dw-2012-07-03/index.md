_The men of David said to him, "Behold, this is the day of which the Lord said to you, 'Behold; I am about to give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'" Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly. — 1 Samuel 24:4_

The phrase, “corner of his robe,” can also be translated “wing of his robe.” When David told Saul what he had done, it seems he was saying, “Look, Saul. I have clipped your wing. You can no longer fly over me as you did before. You have been chasing me all around, but I have now clipped your wing.” Saul was no longer in control. Instead, David was able to capture Saul.
