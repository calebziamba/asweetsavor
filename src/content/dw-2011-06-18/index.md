_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

When we were covering the stage of enlargement in the previous message we spoke a particular word to the younger ones. Now we need to speak a word to the older ones: “Rise up! Fight for the reality of the Lord’s testimony!”

After being in the church life for a long time we often have many complaints. We complain that there is not enough love in the church. We complain about how our spiritual talk in the church life is so different from our practical living. We complain about the lack in the saints’ humanity. But the church can never be built up by murmuring or complaining, even if these complaints are justified. Furthermore, the church can never be built up if we have become indifferent after being in the church life for so long.

Yes, we may be discouraged, but it is because things are discouraging that we need to rise up! Yes, there are many things that bother us in the church life, but those very things should cause us to rise up! We need to rise up just like David, who refused to rest until the Lord’s testimony was constituted with spiritual reality.
