_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves. Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others._ _— Philippians 2:3-4_

_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _— First Corinthians 3:6_

As we value each member, our experience of the body is enriched. This should be such a reality in our daily living. It is not a matter of doing the same thing that others are doing. The reality of the body is high and heavenly, and it is not easily grasped. Whoever has the reality of these verses has seen the body and entered into the experience of it.
