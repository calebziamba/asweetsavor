_Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor? — Romans 9:21_

_But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us. — 2 Corinthians 4:7_

We will now continue to cover our new position after being born again. The next ten points are what we have become since we have taken up our new position.

First, we have become vessels unto honor. The Bible says that human beings are actually vessels (Rom. 9:21). We are each a vessel made by God to contain His divine life (2 Cor. 4:7).

As human beings we are earthen vessels, but when we were born again we each received a heavenly treasure. We became vessels unto honor, because we received the very life of God Himself. Our vessels are earthen, but our content is heavenly. We do not need to think about “going to heaven” one day, because we already have a heavenly content within us. This content, the life of God, makes us a vessel unto honor.
