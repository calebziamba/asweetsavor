_Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”_ _– John 14:6_

A person who is religious or ethical never feels the need to enjoy the life of Christ, for he is satisfied with trying to improve himself and trying to behave properly. But we who are born again have received the need for a new living, a living in which we enjoy and even depend on the life of Christ. We should say, “I don’t want a sinful life, I don’t want an ethical life, I don’t want a worldly life, and I don’t want a religious life. I want a life that comes from the enjoyment of Christ Himself as my life!”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 87-88.
