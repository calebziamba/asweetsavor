_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

Some attach themselves to those who are more influential just to have the opportunity to air their views. Even if we gain indirect influence in this way, it is not a profit to the Lord’s body. Selfish ambition leads many to struggle to have the final word or the greatest prestige, even to the point that they would undermine others. They maneuver themselves into a position of authority because of selfish ambition. I have seen this happen over and over again during my years of serving the Lord.
