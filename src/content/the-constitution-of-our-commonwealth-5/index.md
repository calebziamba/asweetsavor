> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> — Philippians 3:20 Darby

He declared, “I am the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25)! He is full of resurrection power and divine energy. While we may at times experience discouragement and frustration, we must remember that our commonwealth exists in the heavens. Its power is ours to experience continuously.
