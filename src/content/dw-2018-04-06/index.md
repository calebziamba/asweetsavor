_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. —Philippians 2:16_

The reward for running the race is an imperishable wreath, the crown of righteousness (1 Cor. 9:24–25; 2 Tim. 4:8). When we pursue the Lord and grow in life, all those we serve will also pursue Christ for the growth in life.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 134.
