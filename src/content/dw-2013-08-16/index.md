_“I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.’” — Song of Songs 5:2_

The Shulammite considers herself to have achieved the highest level of experience: The Lord has a way in her; she has become the blessing of the church; she has experienced union with the Lord; and she is on her way to resurrection and glory.

The Lord tells her, however, “You are content with your situation before man and God. You are in victory. Everyone praises you. However, I am still homeless. I am still wandering about. Do you realize it is night? Do you know I am outside? Do you know that my head is wet with the dew while you are enjoying your rest? Do you know that I am still suffering without much enjoyment even until now? You, on the contrary, are appreciated and loved as one who bestows so much help to others. I, however, am still wandering and drifting about homeless.”
