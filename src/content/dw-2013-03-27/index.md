_Then David’s anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the Lord lives, surely the man who has done this deserves to die. He must make restitution for the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and had no compassion.” Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man!” – Second Samuel 12:5-7a_

After David’s sin with Bathsheba, God sent Nathan to David to touch his conscience by means of a parable. Nathan told David of two men—one rich and one poor. The poor man had nothing but a little lamb which he treasured dearly. The rich man had many flocks and herds. One night when a visitor came, the rich man didn’t want to kill one of his own lambs, so he stole the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for his guest.

When David heard this, he became very angry and declared, “As the Lord lives, the man who has done this shall surely die!” (2 Sam. 12:5). Nathan then said the memorable words, “You are the man!” (v. 7). He told him the sword would never depart from his house, and that the child born to Bathsheba through his adultery would die. Though David confessed his sin, the child did die, and the sword has never fully departed from David’s house in Israel, even to this day.
