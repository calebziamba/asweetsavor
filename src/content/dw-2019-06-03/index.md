_“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

The church is real to those who are attracted not only by the Lord but also by the brothers and sisters; it is real to those who treasure not only the Lord but also the brothers and sisters; it is real to those who desire to fellowship not only with the Lord, but with all the other saints. They no longer live an individual life, for they are pursuing the Lord together. A virgin who is living such a life can testify, “Lord, the virgins love You."
