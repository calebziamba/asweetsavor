_That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._ _– Ephesians 1:18_

All of the items we have described regarding our new position in Christ are for our experience and enjoyment! The more we enjoy these riches and gain them in our experience, the more wealth there will be for God to inherit. This is not only for our own sake, but for God’s inheritance. Therefore, we should pray:

_“Lord, we want to experience You in every aspect of our new position. We want to enjoy all the riches we received when we were born again!”_

Our experience of these riches will eventually become “the glory of His inheritance in the saints.”
