_Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased him; and he said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?" Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on._

_Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David was playing the harp with his hand, as usual; and a spear was in Saul's hand. Saul hurled the spear for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall." But David escaped from his presence twice._

Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants that they were to kill David, but Jonathan persuaded his father to spare him (1 Sam. 19:1–6). Later, when David returned from another great victory over the Philistines, he again played his harp to relieve Saul of the distressing spirit from the Lord (vv. 8–9). As David played, Saul took up his spear and threw it at him, but David escaped and fled.

Jealousy is terrible. When we hear someone give a good message, we may be stung by jealousy. If we hear someone else being complimented for something, we may be bitten by jealousy.
