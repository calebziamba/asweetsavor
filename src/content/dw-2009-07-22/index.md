When you minister, your words must be with burden and revelation. According to the operation of the Spirit, the words of burden and revelation will produce the operation of the Spirit in others. Such words will not only supply the saints, but also enlighten them. As a result, they will experience renewed consecration, revival, a deeper experience and appreciation of Christ and the church, and give themselves to Christ for the church.

Suppose I am burdened to preach the gospel. When I speak about how people need Jesus, I sow something into those who hear me and the Spirit begins to operate through my words. When my burden is released, it should produce the Spirit's operation in others.
