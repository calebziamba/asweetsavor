## Chapter 4: Finding Resurrection in the Lord’s Field

_For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin._  
(Hebrews 4:15 NKJV)

This chapter introduces a new character--Boaz--and what belongs to him--a field of barley. The name “Boaz” means “in him is strength.” We need to learn that Christ is our Boaz. The Christian life is challenging, perhaps more than we can sometimes bear, but in such times we can come to know our Christ as the one in whom is strength to continue. At the same time, Christ has a field of barley--the church life, which is filled with resurrection. There are many misunderstandings and frustrations in the church life, but in response we should glean resurrection, which lifts us up above everything else into Christ.

## Chapter 5: Christ’s Care in the Church Life

_The Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge._  
(Ruth 2:12 NKJV)

In this chapter, Titus examines Ruth’s experience in the field of Boaz, which is our experience in our local church life. Firstly, it was a field of barley, indicating the resurrection we need to experience in the church life. Secondly, she was among many co-laborers, companions in the church life, all of whom had their particular function, and all of whom were given a caring eye toward Ruth. In the church life, we have our first experiences of Christ Himself (Boaz). He extends food and blessing directly to us, knows our own testimony without our need to broadcast it, and also gives a unique provision for each one--a ministry by which we can feed others. Through Ruth’s experience in the field, she experienced the resurrection life of the Lord, allowing her to enter the deeper experiences of the death of the Lord. The more we experience resurrection, the more we will be strengthened to take the path of the cross.
