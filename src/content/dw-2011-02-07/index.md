_Samuel was ministering before the Lord, a boy clothed with a linen ephod. — First Samuel 2:18_ When Samuel was young, serving in God’s house, he wore the linen ephod, which means he served as a priest. He was not a Levite, but because he was offered as a Nazarite, he was separated unto the Lord and could fill in as a priest before God.

How we dress ourselves spiritually before the Lord is very important, for this determines how we serve. Even when we dress casually on the outside, inwardly we should be girded up, wearing the linen ephod, serving as priests. The day we put on the linen ephod is the day we begin to serve as priests. It is not something to be put on and taken off as we please. If we do, it means that instead of living and serving as priests, we are only participating in certain things in the church life.
