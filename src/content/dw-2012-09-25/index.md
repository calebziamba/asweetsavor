_Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. — Song of Songs 4:4, KJV_

The Lord’s praise for the Shulammite’s neck indicates that she is submissive to His authority. The beauty of her neck indicates the submission of her will. As a tower, she does not face earth but heaven.

However, she is not stiff-necked. She submits to Christ as the King and cooperates with the Lord’s will. David as the king built a tower for the Lord; it was for God’s interest. The maiden’s being as a tower that stood before God proves that she is not stiff-necked but obedient.
