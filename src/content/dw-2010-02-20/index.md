_“All that you say to me I will do.” — Ruth 3:5_ I am concerned for the young people. They have been so strongly influenced to seek independence. Ruth said to Naomi, “All that you say to me I will do” (Ruth 3:5), but how many among us today are so responsive to the lead of those who are older? Often they are seen as out-of-date. In today’s society, young people often do not even listen to their parents.

Ruth’s example portrays a great secret in the spiritual life. We must recognize the order in the Body. Our spiritual growth will be determined by our attitude toward those whom the Lord has placed spiritually ahead of us
