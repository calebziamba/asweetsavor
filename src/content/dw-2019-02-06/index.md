_For I have no one else of kindred spirit \[“like soul,” Gk.\] who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare._  
_– Philippians 2:20_

At times we may argue and complain with those leading us, saying, “Must I listen to you? This is a free country. I should have my vote!” However, if we insist on having our vote, we might vote ourselves out of the church life. Our church will never become prevailing if we do not know how to be like-souled with those leading us, and if they do not know how to be like-souled with one another. We must do our best to carry out the burden of our local church.
