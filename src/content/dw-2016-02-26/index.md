_Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light, for He rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son!_ _– Colossians 1:12-13_

Now that we are born again, we are no longer in darkness, we are no longer under the authority of Satan, we are no longer in sin, we are no longer in death, we are no longer under God’s judgment, we are no longer condemned, we are no longer slaves to impurity and lawlessness, and we are no longer children of wrath and sons of disobedience. Hallelujah, now we have nothing to do with where we were before! By being born again, we have been transferred out of our former position.
