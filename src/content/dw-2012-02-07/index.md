_"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_

The Lord is in the “clefts of the rock,” and He expects that we would also join Him there. He expects us to experience His death on the cross. He is also in the “covert of the precipice,” expecting us to join Him in experiencing the power and riches of His resurrection. He expects that we would become united with Him, so that He could see our countenance and hear our voice in this union with Him.
