_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

Young believers learn from their spiritual fathers how to read the Bible, pray, share the gospel, shepherd others, serve the church, and handle difficult situations. We learn spiritual things as apprentices from our spiritual fathers.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")
