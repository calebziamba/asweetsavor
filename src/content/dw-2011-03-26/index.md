_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste. He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love. Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, For I am sick with love.” — Song of Songs 2:3-5_

Within the first year after he is saved a Christian should have such a turn as the seeker has in the first stage of the Song of Songs.

Within this year, he should know the cross and the breaking of the cross, and he should also know how to live in the church life. We should continue on more and more deeply in this cycle for all of our lives.
