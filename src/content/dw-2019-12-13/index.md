_“My beloved is to me  
__a cluster of henna blossoms  
In the vineyards of Engedi.”  
– Song of Songs 1:14  
_

Engedi was a place in the wilderness to which David fled to find shelter from Saul (1 Sam. 23:29). According to Watchman Nee, “Engedi” means “the fountain of the lamb.” To the seeker, the Lord is both a bundle of myrrh that lies between her breasts and a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi. On the one hand, we are waiting for the Lord and experiencing His death to know Him in a deeper way; on the other, He is even now our shelter and our fountain of life in the wilderness of this dark age.
