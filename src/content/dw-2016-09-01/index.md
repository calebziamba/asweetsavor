On the one hand, we need to be exercised in our character. On the other hand, we must deeply touch the Lord. When we touch Him, He can and will shape our mind. A brother may be prudent, righteous, or persistent. However, his prudence, righteousness, or persistence has to match the growth of the divine life so that it can become a personality that is useful to the Lord.
