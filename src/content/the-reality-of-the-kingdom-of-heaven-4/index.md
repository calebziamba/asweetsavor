> Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come..."
> 
> \- Revelation 12:10a, NASB

When we are all together we can say, "This is the church." Not only Christ is the kingdom of heaven; Not only are we Christians one by one the kingdom of heaven, but eventually the whole congregation—the Church—is the kingdom of heaven. The body of Christ becomes the reality of the kingdom of heaven. When Christ died and resurrected He became not only the Savior of one, but the Savior of all Christians for the body of Christ—the church. We should be very happy that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Why? Because He’s here; Because we believe in Him; Because we can all believe in Him. Because He’s here, I can be saved. Because He’s here, you can be saved. We can all be saved.
