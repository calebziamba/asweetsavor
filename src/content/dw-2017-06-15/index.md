_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_ _– John 1:29_

We were born again to enjoy the living person of Christ, and this includes enjoying Him as our Lamb, the very Lamb of God. The more we enjoy this Christ—that is, the more we experience the Lamb—the more our sins are taken away.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 75.
