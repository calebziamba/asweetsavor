> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ

> \- Philippians 3:8

"All things" includes both the good and the bad, the important and the unimportant, the spiritual and the natural. We find it hard to let certain things go, however, which is why Paul used the word “suffer.”
