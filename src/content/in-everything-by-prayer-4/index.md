> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
> 
> – Philippians 4:6 (NASB)

I hope that if we are ever asked why we chose a certain way in our life, we would be able to say, “Because the Lord told me.” The Lord must be able to move among us. Thus Paul first told us that we must not be for ourselves. Instead, we should be able to do what others cannot by showing forbearance toward all. Second, he told us to pray. We must speak to Christ and fellowship with Him. Practically, I would suggest everyone pray at least half an hour every day. While praying, it is too easy for our minds to wander. We should use the Lord’s name often in our prayer to keep our focus on Him. As we pray in this way, we are brought into a quietness before the Lord. That is a powerful thing. Once we enter into this quietness, we will find it easy to pray for prolonged periods of time.
