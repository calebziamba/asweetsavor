_“How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!_ _How much better is your love than wine,_ _And the fragrance of your oils Than all kinds of spices!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:10_

You may produce much for the Lord, but it is not the “wine” you produce, but your love toward Him, that really can satisfy the Lord.

Love is the banner between the Lord and you. Love is the banner the Lord stretches out over your life—“His banner over me is love” (2:4). You cannot replace this banner with other things in your life. No matter how hard you work, no matter how desperately you labor, no matter how much of a price you pay, the Lord will say it is useless unless He has your love.
