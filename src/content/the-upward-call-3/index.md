> Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:12 ESV

As Christ continues to reveal Himself to us, we are drawn to Him and continue to run after Him. This is why even Paul could not say, after all his intense pursuing, that he had attained (Phil. 3:12â€“13).
