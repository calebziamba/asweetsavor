In our Christian walk, we must have God as our way. God doesn’t give us an experience just for the experience itself but because He wants us to walk in Him and experience Him.

For example, a Christian brother who fails a test in school might say, “This is the discipline of the Spirit. I should study harder next time.” His word may be spiritual, but he isn’t walking in God. When another brother fails a test, it becomes a turning point in his spiritual life because he is walking according to God’s leading and experiencing God Himself. The word of God is alive and God is real to him.
