_Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever. — Psalm 125:1_

It is foolish for anyone to desire to be an overcoming Christian by themselves. If we desire to grow to spiritual maturity by ourselves, and for the sake of ourselves, then we are foolish. Not only are we foolish, but it is impossible anyway.

This psalm shows us the proper understanding of the Lord's trustworthiness. When we realize that the Lord doesn't care for our own spirituality, but instead He cares for His testimony, it should free us from our self-centered Christian life. We will have a deeper consecration which deals with our self-life. Then we will joyfully declare to the Lord, “I don't care how spiritual I am! I don't care what condition I'm in! I don't care whether I am victorious or defeated! But Lord, I want to tell You, I love You and I love Your church! I give myself to Your trustworthiness! I don't care for myself anymore! I only care for You and for Your testimony!” This is to consecrate ourselves to the Lord's trustworthiness. Then we are truly “like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever.”
