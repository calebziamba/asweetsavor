_But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin. â€” First John 1:7_ Sometimes, though you may not have spent time alone with the Lord, you still experience cleansing as you fellowship with others. You feel refreshed and ready to pursue the Lord again. Learn to come to the Lord privately to confess your sins, and learn also to come to the light through fellowship with others.
