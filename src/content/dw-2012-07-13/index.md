_Please, let not my lord regard this scoundrel Nabal. For as his name is, so is he._ _— First Samuel 25:25_

Abigail confessed that her husband was foolish. She went on to indicate that things would have been different if David had sent his men to her instead of to her husband. She then said, “Since the Lord has held you back from coming to bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now then, let your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be as Nabal” (v. 26).
