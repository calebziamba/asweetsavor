_For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. — First Corinthians 12:12_

_Now you are the Body of Christ, and members in particular — First Corinthians 12:27_

The Body life can be demonstrated by looking at our own physical body. When we look at our body, we realize that God is truly wise. Only God could put things together in such a wonderful way. We are fitly framed together in every detail. Every part of our body is fully coordinated. Every member has its particular function, yet all the members function together as one body.

This is even more true of the Body of Christ. When we are born again, we become members of the Body of Christ. We receive the necessity of a new living. We can no longer be by ourselves. We can no longer remain isolated individuals. Our new living is a corporate living, in which we function in harmony with all the other members of the Body of Christ.
