_Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth. —2 Timothy 2:15_

For the equipping of the truth, you should first know the facts of the Bible. Second, you must enter into the riches of Brother Nee and Brother Lee. Third, you have to employ everything the Lord has given to us and not be a narrow or self-complacent person. Fourth, you have to learn to use the reference tools. Do not be afraid of them. You must have the courage to get into them. If the result of your study is different from Brother Lee’s, you should consider why there is a difference.

We must have a spirit of learning.Adapted from _[Being One with the Ministry](/book-one-with-the-ministry-vol-2 "Go to the listing for this book.")[,](/book-journey/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ Volume Two, page 20.
