> Sustain me with raisin cakes,  
> Refresh me with apples,  
> Because I am lovesick.”
> 
> – Song of Songs 2:5

The “raisin cakes” indicate that what the seeker needs now is life, a life that is processed, for raisin cakes are produced through a process. Such a process speaks of maturity, of a life that has been dried out from the things of the world and broken by the work of the cross. Only those who have experienced such a process can render to us the real help. They can help us to enlarge our capacity, and they can also sustain us. Our fellowship with them causes us to become those who not only enjoy the Lord’s life, but who can also help and sustain others to enjoy that life as well.
