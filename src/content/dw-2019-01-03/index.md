It is not easy to know we are in God’s hand. If we apply for a job and get hired, we may think it is because we are so capable. We don’t know God’s hand. If we aren’t hired, we may complain. We don’t recognize God’s hand here either. If we know God’s blessing hand and have revelation, we can say, like James George Deck,

_Yet in Thy love such depths I see,_ _My soul o’erflows with praise;_ _Contents itself while, Lord, to Thee_ _My joyful song I raise._

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 132.
