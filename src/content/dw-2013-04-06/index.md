_The king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And thus he said as he walked, “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”_ _– Second Samuel 18:33_

Because David was unable to act on behalf of the kingdom, Joab rebuked him, saying, “You have disgraced all your servants who today have saved your life...in that you love your enemies and hate your friends....I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today, then it would have pleased you well” (2 Sam. 19:5–6).  That was a good rebuke. Then he instructed David, “Arise, go out and speak comfort to your servants. For I swear by the Lord, if you do not go out, not one will stay with you this night” (v. 7).

David was so consumed with grief over Absalom, he forgot his responsibility to his people. Joab’s frank word brought him back to reality. He met with the people at the gate and they were encouraged. This entire situation would have been averted if only David had not exercised favoritism toward Absalom.
