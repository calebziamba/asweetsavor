_“Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.”_

_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.”

_

_— Song of Songs 2:17-3:1_

Brothers and sisters, this is serious. Many of us cherish the goodness and sweetness of our “bed.” We cherish those wonderful spiritual experiences. However, we should only treasure the Lord Himself. Without the Lord on the bed, it is empty.

It is a pity that many are holding on to their beds instead of the Lord. Some people enjoy the sweetness of praying so much that they care for nothing but praying, even if it means ignoring the Lord. If a brother asks such a one to go with him to visit a saint, that person will consider it an interruption to his intimate fellowship with the Lord, and will chafe at this brother’s interruption. He will ask the Lord to catch the little foxes—meaning anything that interrupts his “fellowship” with the Lord. Even if the interruption is from the Lord, he hopes that the Lord would take it away and bind it. This is what happens when our bed replaces the Lord’s authority and preeminence in our lives.
