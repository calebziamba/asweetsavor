_For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit. â€” First Corinthians 12:13_

There are two aspects to our new living. The first is the enjoyment of Christ, and the second is our living in the Body of Christ and the practical church life.

These two aspects of the new living are closely related. We can only have the enjoyment of Christ in the Body of Christ, and our enjoyment makes us a blessing to the Body. All of our enjoyment of Christ is actually for the Body of Christ. Then this new living for the Body of Christ is practically experienced in the local church life. Our operation in the local church life should issue out from our enjoyment of Christ.
