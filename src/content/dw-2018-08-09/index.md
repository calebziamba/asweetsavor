_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Has God’s life restrained our diet? Has God’s life affected our response when a car cuts us off in traffic? Has God’s life affected our attitude when someone offends us? These may all seem like trivial things, but salvation by the life of God touches all of them. Those who are experiencing such things can be sure they are living in God’s organic salvation. Their reactions to things will come from God, and their living will manifest a son of God.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 16.
