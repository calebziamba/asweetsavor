_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’”_ _–  Acts 7:2-3_

God has power. With this power He caused Abraham to have a son by Sarah. With this power He enabled Abraham to walk before Him.

We have two protections in our walk: from God’s side, He is always the same; from our side, we experience His power continuously. The exceeding greatness of His power is toward us (Eph. 1:19). Since He never changes, we can experience His power and preservation. As a result, God’s purpose will be fulfilled in us. How wonderful is God’s calling!
