_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

When we see saints who love the Lord and give everything to Him, we know they have their song of songs within them. As Jesus lovers ourselves, we should realize that we have our own song of songs.  
  
If we don’t have a healthy relationship with the Lord or with the church, we may feel that the Lord is more gracious to others than to us. We may feel that their Lord is sweeter to them and that their song is more pleasant. But if we have a healthy relationship with the Lord, we would say, “The Lord is not only yours; He is also mine. The value of my Lord is not less than yours. The Lord is your lover and He is mine, too. I have a song within me, and it is my song of songs.”
