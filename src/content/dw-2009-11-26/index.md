_How blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah, Who walks in His ways. When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, You will be happy and it will be well with you. Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine Within your house, Your children like olive plants Around your table. Behold, for thus shall the man be blessed Who fears Jehovah Jehovah bless you from Zion, And may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life. Indeed, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel! — Psalm 128:1-6_

The psalm continues, “Thus will the man be blessed who fears Jehovah. Jehovah bless you from Zion; and may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life” (v. 4-5). Now we are blessed, and we become a blessing. When we live such a life, we become a profit to the Lord’s testimony. The next verse says, “May you also see the children of your children” (v. 6a). Our being a blessing to the churches is no longer limited. The blessing here is for generations to come.
