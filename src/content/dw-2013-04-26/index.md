_For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings._ _– Hebrews 2:10_

Most Bible scholars attribute the book of Hebrews to the apostle Paul. Hebrews tells us that Christ is everything. Our Christian life as depicted in Paul’s epistles begins with Romans and concludes with Hebrews. Romans shows us God’s salvation for man and His purpose for man. Hebrews shows us how God’s salvation brings us to glory. Paul’s fourteen epistles are a matter of growth in life, which consummates in the maturity found in Hebrews.
