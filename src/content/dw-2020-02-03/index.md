_"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same  
things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you."  
\- Philippians 3:1  
_

Paul wanted to show the Philippians the goal of his living and service. Though he was imprisoned in Rome, he was able  
to rejoice as he pursued Christ.
