_Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus. — Romans 15:5_

One accord comes from the saints having the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus (Rom. 15:5). Do you think it is possible to have the same mind toward one another? In the church life, all the saints should have the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus.

There should be no selection; all the saints should be loved. This is contrary to us. Caucasians automatically love Caucasians. The Chinese love the Chinese, and the African Americans love African Americans. According to our preference, we love the brothers who are gifted, useful, talented, those who can be pillars and elders. However, if you want one accord, there is no preference. Paul says, “When you are in one accord giving the glory to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, then you will have the same mind towards one another, the mind of Christ.”
