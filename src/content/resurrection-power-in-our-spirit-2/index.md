Whenever our spirit is made alive, spontaneously all our problems no longer overwhelm us. When the Spirit is present in our church life, the power of resurrection is present, granting us the ability to lay hold of Christ in our situation. This is to know Christ and the power of His resurrection. When we are in spirit, we experience this power, and when we each experience this power of resurrection, Christ becomes the center of the church life.

From [_Philippians: That I May Gain Christ_](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/) by Titus Chu, p. 198
