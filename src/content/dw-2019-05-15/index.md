_“For your love is better than wine.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2_

Wine represents something that used to satisfy us and give us enjoyment (cf. John 2:3). We all had some kind of wine that we thought was the best thing in our lives. However, now we feel, “Lord, Your love is better than any wine I have ever had. When I have Your love, everything I experienced before fades away.”

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, pages 20-21.
