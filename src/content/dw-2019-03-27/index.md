_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._ _– Philippians 1:1_

_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_  
  
Serving as bond-servants requires three things: a stand, a commitment, and a proper labor. Our stand produces our commitment, and our commitment produces our labor.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 162.
