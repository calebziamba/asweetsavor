> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, all who are mature, letâ€™s have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that to you as well;

Perfection, or maturity, is not a matter of quantity but of quality. For instance, it is not a matter of how many verses we have memorized or how many Christian conferences we have attended. Being perfect, mature, or full grown is our growing up in all things into Christ (Eph. 4:15). We come to a certain stature based on our growth (Eph. 4:13).
