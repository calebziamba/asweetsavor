_But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the bondwoman and her son, For the son of the bondwoman shall not be an heir with the son of the free woman.”_ _– Galatians 4:30_

If we carry out a Christian work according to our own strength, eventually this will become a frustration to the true work of the Spirit. “As at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also” (v. 29).

We need God’s promise and free grace so that we can become spiritual, without any impure motive. He enables us to face everything in the spirit by faith. We don’t want Eliezer or Ishmael. We need the Lord’s mercy so that we become a true Isaac, simple and reliant only on God.
