_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus.  
– Philippians 1:1  
  
But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father._  
_– Philippians 2:22_

When the Lord finally sees the result of all His labor, He will be satisfied. The church is not produced miraculously overnight but through a maturing process that takes a long period of time.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 163.
