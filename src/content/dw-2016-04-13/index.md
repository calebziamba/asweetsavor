After God judged the world with the flood, His work on man was no longer according to man’s behavior. Although Noah had been described as “a righteous man, blameless in his time” (6:9), after the flood Noah “drank of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent” (9:21). This shows that God’s work on man was not based on man’s behavior. No matter how fallen we are, we can come to Him like a child and ask for His mercy. We now live in a new age with a new covenant in which God bears all the responsibility.
