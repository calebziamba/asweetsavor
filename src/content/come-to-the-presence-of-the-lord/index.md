“Come to Me” (Matthew 11:28). “Abide in Me” (John 15:4). These callings have echoed down through the centuries and beckoned countless Christians into a deeper inner life, a life in the presence of the Lord Himself. In this book, Titus Chu seeks to enrich each reader’s inner life with the Lord through a consideration of four crucial items: who the Lord is, how the Lord has flowed Himself out, means by which we may approach the Lord, and how our oneness with the Lord is manifested. Therefore, this book contains not only spiritual inspirations but also revelations and some means of practice. To fellowship with the Lord is not a mysterious or strange meditation. There are some ways we can practice. Every Christian has the Bible in hand and the Spirit dwelling within, but the inner life also requires the revelation of the Word and ways of practice. With both inner revelation and outward practice, we may come to the Lord and abide under the shadow of the Almighty, be saturated with the teaching of the anointing, realize the secret of the Lord, and manifest oneness with Him. This book shows this precious foundation of a Christian’s lifelong journey and the highest privilege we have as believers. Yes, come to the presence of the Lord!
