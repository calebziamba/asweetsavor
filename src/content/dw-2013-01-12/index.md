_“You are altogether beautiful, my darling,_ _And there is no blemish in you.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:7_

_As sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things._ _— Second Corinthians 6:10_

The seeker knows that her love relation with the Lord does not merely lead her to read the Bible, go to meetings, or just say, “I love you, Lord.” This love relationship comes with a price. Therefore, she has to go to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.

Up to this point her experience of the cross has not been the result of her own obedience. Now, however, she begins to respond to the Lord’s call in chapter 2 to “rise up and come away” (2:10). Therefore she begins to pay the price, and now she becomes one who is losing yet gaining, “as poor yet making many rich” (2 Cor. 6:10). The Lord now can tell her, “You are beautiful. You satisfy My heart. You are no longer a mare; now you are My beauty” (cf. 4:7).
