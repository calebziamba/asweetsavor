We tend to be negotiators. We equivocate. If we say, “Lord, I will give You Monday and Thursday,” then our blessing will be Monday and Thursday, but not the rest of the week. Due to this compromise, we refuse to walk through the whole land.

However, every place that the sole of our foot treads upon belongs to us. Our attitude should be, “I want to explore Christ! I want to develop the Christ who is in me! I want to be in the divine Word! I want to have a living Christ! I want Christ to govern me day by day!” In every instant and every situation He must be our Lord.
