Without Barnabas, Paul’s Christian life would have been very different. Barnabas initiated the fellowship between Paul and Peter. When Paul met Peter, no doubt he shared all the enlightenment he had received while in Arabia. Peter probably did not understand much of what Paul tried to communicate. Even thirty years later, Peter wrote that Paul’s letters were hard to understand, yet he still referred to them as Scripture (2 Pet. 3:15–16).
