Different brothers have to exercise their characters to become exact, strict, diligent, and broad. But no matter how much they exercise, one brother’s nature will not become the same as the other’s. After 30 years, they will still have their own natures. However, if the Lord has mercy, each of them may have a personality that is useful to the Lord.
