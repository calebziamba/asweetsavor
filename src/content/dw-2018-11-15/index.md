Once, when I was a young Christian, I saw a church elder smoking. I thought someone who had been with the Lord for such long time should be strong and prevailing. I prayed for him, and in that prayer I shared a little in the feeling of his weakness. Two or three weeks later, he gave a testimony, saying, “Do you realize we have no ability to overcome even the three inches of a cigarette?” Soon afterward, he stopped smoking. It would have been easy to judge this brother and even expose him, but how much better to share the feeling of his weakness in prayer.
