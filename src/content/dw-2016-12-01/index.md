_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you’”_ _–  Acts 7:2-3_

When God called Abraham, He said, “Leave your country and your relatives.” This call was followed by God’s promise: “And come into the land that I will show you.” Here we see the land of promise. God’s call brings in His promise. How wonderful that our Lord is living! He is not a distant God far away in the heavens. He initiates, He appears, He calls, and He promises.
