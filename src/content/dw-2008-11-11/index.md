_That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. â€” 1 John 1:3_

John's ministry was focused on the growth in life for the building up of the Body within the local churches. His approach was not to prevail in Paul's manner, but to minister with sweetness. He spoke to the fathers, the young men, and the children in the church life. Eventually his ministry produced a sweet and proper fellowship between the servants of the Lord and the churches. To enter into fellowship with John was to enter into the fellowship he enjoyed with the Father and the Son. When we are brought into such fellowship, then the Father is there, and the Son is also there. How sweet this is!
