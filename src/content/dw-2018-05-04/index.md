_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God._ _— Romans 1:1_

The gospel of God first addresses the need of humanity. We are told at the very beginning of Romans that people need the gospel of God (Rom. 1:1–2). However, people only need the gospel because God also has a need. Man’s need is based on God’s need. In God’s eyes, if He had no need, people would likewise have no need. But since God needs to accomplish His eternal purpose, people need the gospel of God.
