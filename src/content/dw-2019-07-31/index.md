_“For why should I be like one who veils herself_ _Beside the flocks of your companions?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

When we are seeking to help people, we need to bring them to the Lord’s presence so that they can learn to have a direct relationship with the Lord Himself, rather than to merely do an outward work. We need to help people live before the Lord, for what matters is not our work but our relationship with the Lord. Although doing some work can satisfy a certain need for a time, nothing can replace the Lord Himself.

Thus, the prayer of the seeker in this section of the Song of Songs is very good. Although she is wandering as one veiled beside the flocks of the Lord’s companions, not knowing what her portion is, she still is seeking the Lord Himself with all her heart. We need to pray over and over, “Please tell me, Lord, where is the fullest rest and the richest nourishment? I am not satisfied, nor am I at rest. How can I enjoy You more? How can I know You more?” We need to be like her, knowing that all the supply and rest are from the Lord Himself. It is only by holding fast to the Lord Himself that we can go on, even when we are wandering.
