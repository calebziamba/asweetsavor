> _But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him._
> 
> \- 1 Corinthians 6:17

On the day we believed in Him, He came to us and we became joined to Him in one spirit. What is this life now in our spirit? It is the very self-existing and ever-existing God.

Excerpted from _[What is Eternal Life](https://www.asweetsavor.org/what-is-eternal-life/)_ by Titus Chu
