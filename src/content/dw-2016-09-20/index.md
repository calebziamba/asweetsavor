_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._ _— Philippians 2:5–7_

The background of Paul’s portrayal of Christ In Philippians 2:5–11 is his concern for the Philippians. Unlike the Galatians, they did not have a problem regarding matters of truth. Paul’s concern for the Philippians was their lack in the experience of Jesus’ humanity. This is why he charged them to be “of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose” (v. 2) and to “do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves” (v. 3).
