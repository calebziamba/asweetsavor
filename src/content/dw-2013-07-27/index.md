_I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all._ _— Philippians 1:3–4_

When we become aware of other people’s problems, we should try praying as Paul did: “Thank You, Lord, that these dear believers love You.” Paul was an effective servant of the Lord because in any situation, he saw something to be appreciated; in every believer, he saw someone to be thankful for. He had discernment to see problems, yet he didn’t focus on them. He didn’t pray our kind of prayers. If we learn to appreciate even the weakest and most backslidden believers, our service will become much more effective, and many positive things would begin to happen.

Paul’s love for the Philippians was like a parent’s love. All parents think their children are the best and others’ children are not as good. They have so much love for their children that they only see the best in them. They always have hope for their children, even when things are not so encouraging. This was Paul’s attitude. He had so much love and care for the Philippians’ believers that he was constantly joyful in his remembrance of them.
