_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,  
set apart for the gospel of God Which He promised beforehand  
through His prophets in the holy Scriptures"  
\-Romans 1:1-2  
_

The whole Bible concerns the gospel of God. Even though we can find history, literature, biographies, prophecies, miracles, and human philosophy in its pages, these things are not its center. What does the Bible focus on? What does it want to reveal and talk about? Nothing but the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, who is the gospel promised by God through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures. The Old Testament is full of gospel messages that contain the promise of Christ.
