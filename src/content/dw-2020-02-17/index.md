_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

In the Bible, dogs are unclean animals that are said to vomit up their food and then return to eat it again (Prov. 26:11, 2 Pet. 2:22). Paul was telling the Philippians that some in the church life have a dog nature. These vomit out the things they have taken in. They are always in the process of taking in the Word, but it never becomes a part of them. What is holy, after they are finished with it, is transformed into something unclean.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 180.
