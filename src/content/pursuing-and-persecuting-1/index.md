> Not that I have already obtained the prize , or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession of it , seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus . 
> 
> \- Philippians 3:12

At the time Paul wrote to the Philippians, he was still pursuing or “persecuting” the Lord Jesus—now in a good way—even to the point that he didn’t care if the Lord could tolerate it. We shouldn’t worry about being too much for the Lord Jesus. We should bother Him to the extent He doesn’t know what to do with us. This is true pursuing.
