_“God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”_ _– John 4:24_

When we enjoy Christ, we are actually giving God the worship He desires, because to God, the true worship is the enjoyment of Christ. This enjoyment takes place in our human spirit, where the Spirit of reality unveils all the riches of Christ to us.
