When Simon declared that the Lord Jesus was “the Christ, the Son of the Living God” (Matt. 16:16) the Lord replied, in Matthew 16:18,

_I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it._

Later, in his first letter to his fellow believers, this same Peter said that we are all “living stones” who are being built up to be God’s house (1 Pet. 2:5).
