_I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. â€” Ephesians 1:18-20_

Resurrection is the mark of the church life. What is resurrection? First, resurrection is the defeat of all that belongs to death. Second, resurrection rises above every environment. Third, resurrection is a divine and mystical realm. When we are in resurrection, we experience all three of these. In spite of all the gossip, religious zeal, and intolerance of others, we find that we simply cannot give up. We are upheld and brought into another realm.

Once we are brought into resurrection, we are above all that frustrates. Resurrection brings us through incident after incident, case after case, until we are in the heavenlies above every storm. Resurrection is a power that lifts us up into the heavenly realm. This realm is Christ Himself.
