_“Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against the Lord’s anointed, and be guiltless?” — First Samuel 26:9_

David’s realization was that since God had anointed Saul as king, Saul was God’s responsibility. I hope no one would ever say, “Our church leaders are no good,” for on the entire globe no one is good.

David acknowledged God’s selection in anointing Saul as the king and recognized Saul as the one appointed by God to lead all of Israel ahead of him. We all must realize that God is over all such selections.
