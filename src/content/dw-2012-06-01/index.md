_“The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’ Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me.” — Song of Songs 3:3-4_ The riches of the Lord are inexhaustible. We will always be able to experience and enjoy Him further. May we be poor in spirit; let us be humble and empty ourselves before the Lord and say, “Lord, I am nothing, but You are all. Fill me every moment so that I can fully express You.”
