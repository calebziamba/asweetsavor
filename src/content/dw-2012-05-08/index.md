_"On my bed night after night I sought him Whom my soul loves; I sought him but did not find him. I must arise now and go about the city." — Song of Songs 3:1-2_

At this point the maiden rises up and goes about in the city, in the streets and in the squares, and seeks Him whom her soul loves. The city here refers to the church, and the streets and the squares indicate the display and exhibition of the saints’ rich experience of Christ (cf. Prov. 8:1-4). She seeks the Lord within the church. She thinks she can find the Lord she loves among brothers and sisters.
