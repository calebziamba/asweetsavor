_In whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will. — Ephesians 1:11_ The last point concerning our new position is that we have become God's inheritance (Eph. 1:11). We, the believers, were designated as God's inheritance. But only when we experience the previous items of our new position can God's inheritance be fully realized.

The apostle Paul prayed for the believers, “The eyes of your heart having been enlightened that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints” (Eph. 1:18). All of us are God's inheritance. God is going to inherit us, whether we are faithful to Him or not. The question is, how much of us is God going to inherit? Some believers will have a lot of riches for God to inherit. Other believers will have only a little. If a person was born again, but never followed the Lord his whole life, God will inherit only that small part of him which was for the Lord.

All of these items are for our experience and enjoyment. The more we enjoy the riches of our new position, the more wealth there will be for God to inherit. The spiritual riches we gain in this age are not for our own sake, but for God's inheritance. We should pray, “Lord, we want to experience You in every aspect of our new position. We want to enjoy all the riches we received when we were born again.” Our experience of these riches will eventually become “the glory of His inheritance in the saints.”
