_Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord._ _– Genesis 13:18_

When we follow the Lord and live in the church life, we need to fellowship with God continually, signified by “Hebron,” which means “fellowship.” In the fellowship, God provides us with all the riches so that we can live a life of the altar and tent. The altar represents a life lived totally for God, and the tent represents a life not settled on the earth.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; pages 91-92.
