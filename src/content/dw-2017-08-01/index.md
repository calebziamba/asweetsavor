_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’" – Acts 7:2-3_

Like Abraham, we also met God on the day of our salvation, and like Abraham, we had no idea where He would take us. We were very simple. When we met Him, all we wanted to do was to love Him and follow Him. Our first vision was of Him alone. We must abide in this vision continually.
