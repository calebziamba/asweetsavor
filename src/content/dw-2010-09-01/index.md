_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

In the midst of this process you will often feel unclear, blocked, frustrated, or even dead. But at such a time the Spirit will constitute you, and the Triune God will work on you, bringing out a further expression of the gold. The more constitution you have, the more of a golden plaited crown you will gain.

When you see some saints in the church, you just feel they are shining and glorious and that there are many crowns upon them. This is the result of God’s special work with them through the cross, by which He has made them plaits of gold.
