_"On my bed night after night I sought him Whom my soul loves; I sought him but did not find him. I must arise now and go about the city." â€” Song of Songs 3:1-2_

What God focuses on is your obedience to His will. To deal with trivial things is not His focus. If you are unwilling to fully consecrate yourself and follow Him, you remain wrong in the sight of God, and you will be a useless vessel.

In this circumstance, regardless how good your behavior may be, how holy you are, or how much spiritual activity you may engage in, it will all be in vain. It is useless for you to be zealous, to be good at stirring up a meeting, or to try to visit and take care of the saints. It will even be useless for you to try to serve full-time. You need to fear God and cooperate with Him absolutely. You should care for His will regardless of your gain or loss. The way of the Lord will be open to you only when you count all things to be loss.
