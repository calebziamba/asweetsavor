_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

Many who proclaim that they have given their all to Christ and the church have not done so in reality. Therefore, they are not able to present others with a clear and bright testimony. We should be able to say, “I live for this, and I die for this. Whether the church is blessed, or whether things are difficult, I will not be moved. Nothing can tear me away from this stand!” By taking such a stand, we hold fast the word of life.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 132.
