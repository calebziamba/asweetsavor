_This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you._ _â€“ John 15:12_

We were born again into the body of Christ. Therefore, we should no longer be by ourselves, nor should we just care for ourselves. Rather, we should love one another, we should keep the oneness, and we should feed and shepherd the lambs and the sheep. These are the three commissions for us in the Gospel of John. May the Lord be merciful to us!

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 101-102.
