> \[The Lord Jesus Christ\] will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.
> 
> – Philippians 3:21

The degree of our sanctification and transformation has so much to do with how much we are renewed. Tell the Lord, “Lord, renew me day by day. Renew my spirit, my mind, and my apprehension of spiritual things.” Our growth has so much to do with our renewing.
