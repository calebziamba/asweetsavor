_"The king has brought me into his chambers." — Song of Songs 1:4b_

_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste. He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:3-4_

The Lord will then bring us into the banqueting house. “Banqueting house” can also be translated “house of wine.” At first, the Lord brought us into His chambers, which was a personal experience. Now He brings us into the house of wine, which belongs to all His people. We can be joyful together with others in the house of wine.

Individually, I experience the divine life. Corporately, I also experience the divine life. Individually, I sit down in the shade of the Lord as a wonderful fruit tree, and His fruit is sweet to my taste. I feel like I am being raptured, for His life surrounds me. With others, I am brought into the banqueting house, the house of wine.

Now I can enjoy the Lord unto perfection. I am no longer alone, but with all my brothers and sisters enjoying the Lord and experiencing His riches. I am so joyful, and so are all the brothers and sisters.
