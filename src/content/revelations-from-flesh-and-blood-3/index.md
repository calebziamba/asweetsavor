The vanity of the soul causes people to pursue the material world. You know, I believe if we have one thousand listening to this message, five hundred listening to this, only one or two may have some experience or still be in the previous category. The majority of us are in the second category. Are we sinful? No, but we’re occupied. We seemingly have a vision. Something caught us. I want to be a professor, even a known professor, I want to be CEO, even a successful CEO, I’m a writer, I want to have my books written, I want to have my business, I want to have my school, I want... you know brothers, there’s a lot of things that are actually all vanity. Eventually, where’s the value? But in the process, flesh and blood still can attract you – attract you to get a degree, a better degree, a top university, and to even gain success in a certain field, I tell you brother, this is a world thing
