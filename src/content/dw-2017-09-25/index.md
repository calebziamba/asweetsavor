_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

We need the Lord’s mercy that we would be brought to the end of ourselves so that we can only bow down before the Lord and laugh. We can only know ourselves in the light of His life. We must allow the Lord’s life to work on us, to lead us, and to bring us into deeper experiences of Him.
