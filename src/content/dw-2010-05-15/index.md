_And I have made Your name known to them and will yet make it known, that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them. — John 17:26_

Here we see how the Lord concludes His prayer. We need to see that all the previous items must be practiced in love. This is because the church life is a life in love. We can practice not loving the world, being filled in spirit, being sanctified by the word, and keeping the Lord’s name. But it is the intrinsic element of love that goes beyond doing what is right. It is love that becomes the real secret upholding the genuine one accord.

Every father knows that his son may not be perfect, but he is not willing to throw him out. Why? This is because he loves his son. This love allows the son to grow up and develop properly. Likewise, in the church life it is in the sphere of love that we do not love the world, can be filled in spirit, are sanctified by the word, and keep the Lord’s name, exalting only Christ.
