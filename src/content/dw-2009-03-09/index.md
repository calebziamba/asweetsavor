_Giving thanks to the Father...who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. — Colossians 1:12a-13_

When we were born again we received a change in our position. Before we were saved we were in one place, the authority of darkness. After we were saved we were in another place, the kingdom of the Son of His love. By being born again we have been transferred from the kingdom of Satan to the kingdom of God. This means that our position has changed. In order to fully appreciate our new position we must examine the position we have left behind. We will look at eight different aspects of the negative position we were in before we were born again.

Before we were born again, we were in darkness. We couldn't see anything clearly. We were blind to the things of God and even to the purpose of our own human life. We didn't know whether God truly existed. We didn't know that we needed a Savior. Our human life was empty and meaningless. This shows that we were in darkness. But Colossians 1:13 tells us that by being born again we were “delivered out of the authority of darkness.”

When the Lord Jesus appeared to the apostle Paul and commissioned him to preach the gospel, the Lord sent him to the Gentiles to “open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God” (Acts 26:18). Furthermore, First Peter 2:9 tells us that the Lord has “called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.” These are wonderful verses, but they show us that before we were born again our position was just darkness.
