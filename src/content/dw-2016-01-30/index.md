_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

_Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus._ _– Romans 15:5_

How do we help those in a troubled situation? We should console them in Christ. We should console and treasure them in love, unveiling to them the God who gives perseverance and encouragement (Rom. 15:5). We should fellowship with them in spirit. In all this, however, we cannot have a superior attitude. We must come with humility of mind, following the Lord’s example (Phil. 2:5–8).
