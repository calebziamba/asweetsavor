_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

Whenever you are involved in spiritual activities, you feel that you are a high person. You may even feel that you are on the “cutting edge” of the church life. The Lord desires to make us low, but we desire to be high. We like to rise up, but the Lord tells us to come down. The Lord will arrange everything in our environment for us to be made low.

It is for this reason that the psalmist says, “The plowers plowed on my back; they made their furrows long.” This portrays a deep experience in life. The Lord will cause a plow to bring us low. The Lord not only makes us low, He also cuts us deeply. When we are plowed and brought low, it is to the degree that no one sees us. We are no longer up front, and we are no longer so high. We are as low as a furrow in the ground. We are in a situation where no one even sees our face. Although we have given ourselves to the Lord and His purpose, for some reason the elders don’t even notice us. We have been so desperate to consecrate ourselves to Christ, yet no one finds that out. This means that we are brought low. We are even “cut” in our experience. We are like the earth, being plowed upon our back.
