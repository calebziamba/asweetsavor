_Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, shall I not seek some resting place for you, that it may be well with you?" — Ruth 3:1_

In Ruth chapter three, Naomi really cared for Ruth. Many times we may hold on to certain people because we feel they are profitable to us and to the church. If we care for what they can do for us more than for their spiritual growth, we frustrate the church from realizing the greater blessing that comes with their growth. We should be for others’ profit and consider what is best for them rather than how they might be of help to us.

Naomi realized that the next stage of growth for Ruth was finding rest with Boaz. We should care for those with us in the same way. Has the person of Christ become their rest to the degree that He should?
