_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

At any specific moment, different people may be in different stages of transformation. Two brothers may say, “I am for Christ and the church!” However, though their words are the same, they may mean two very different things.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 17.
