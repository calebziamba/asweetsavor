_Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. — Ephesians 2:20-22_ The building of the Body should not be by our human effort. It is not a matter of saying to each other, “I want to be built up with you.” Although it is good to say this, if we really want to be built up together we should enjoy the person of Christ. He is the Builder of His Body.

The more we enjoy Christ as a living person in our spirit, the more we are built into the Body of Christ. The more we labor on Christ, enjoy the person of Christ, and spend time in the Lord's presence, the more we will be one with all the other members of the Body. The building of the Body of Christ takes place through our enjoyment of the Builder Himself. We don't have to make up our minds and struggle to be built up. We can be built up with others simply by enjoying the living person of Christ, the Builder of the Body.
