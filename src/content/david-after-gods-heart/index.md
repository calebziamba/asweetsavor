_This book is compiled from messages given during a summer training in 2005. You may listen to the original messages here: ["2005 Summer Training: David--A Man After God's Heart"](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-david)_

King David was a truly remarkable servant of the Lord, and yet in many ways he was just like us. On the one hand he truly cared about what God was after; God Himself declared him to be “a man after My own heart” (1 Sam. 13:14; Acts 13:22) even while he was still just a shepherd boy. On the other hand, David was often not clear about God’s purpose, and he also experienced many failures, sins, disappointments, and sufferings as he followed and served the Lord.

Through such a one, God was able to establish His kingdom, gain the city He desired, and prepare the way for the building up of the temple, His dwelling place on the earth. What a marvelous story, and what an encouragement to us in our own Christian life and serving today!

In _David: After God’s Heart_, Titus Chu draws lessons for us today from the life of David, a King of Israel and the forebear of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.
