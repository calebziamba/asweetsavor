_So David took the spear and the jug of water from beside Saul’s head, and they went away, but no one saw or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a sound sleep from the Lord had fallen on them. — First Samuel 26:12_

Instead of killing Saul, David took Saul’s spear and jug of water. Once David had put a great distance between himself and Saul’s camp, he called out to Abner, the commander of Saul’s army, saying, “Why...have you not guarded your lord the king? ...You deserve to die, because you have not guarded your master, the Lord’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the jug of water that was by his head” (1 Sam 26:15–16).
