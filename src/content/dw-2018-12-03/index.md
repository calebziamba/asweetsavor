_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

The first experience of the called ones is the experience of Abraham, which is to know God as our unique source, way, and portion. The second experience of the called ones is the experience of Isaac, the son of Abraham. Isaac was the heir. In him we see how the called ones inherit all the Father’s riches in Christ the Son.
