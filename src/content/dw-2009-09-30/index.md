_Obey the ones leading you and submit to them, for they watch over your souls as those who will render an account, that they may do this with joy and not groaning; for this would be unprofitable to you. — Hebrews 13:17_

Let me use this opportunity to say a word about the headship in the church life. In the church life all thoughts of democracy are satanic. You should not ask all the time, “Why are we doing it this way?” You should not question the elders' headship, or question that the elders are under Christ's headship. To question things in the church life is to show you do not trust that the elders are under the headship of Christ. This insults Christ's headship.

It is very serious to question the elders in any way. Whether the elder is right or wrong, you should not touch it. Even if the elder is wrong, it can turn out right. But if you touch it, then even if he is right, it will end up wrong. Do not make the church a place where the elders must submit to the members. Once this happens, the church testimony is over. To threaten the elders and try to force them to do what you want is satanic.
