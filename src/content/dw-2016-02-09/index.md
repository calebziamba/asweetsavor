Before we were born again, we were blind to the things of God and even to the purpose of our own human life. We didn’t know whether God truly existed, we didn’t know that we needed a Savior, and our human life was empty and meaningless. If brief, we were just in darkness. When Paul was brought before King Agrippa, he testified that the Lord had appeared to him and commissioned him to preach the gospel. He said, in Acts 26:18, that the Lord had told him he was being sent to the Gentiles

_to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God._

The apostle Peter, in 1 Peter 2:9, also speaks of this transfer, when he tells us that the Lord has called us

_out of darkness into His marvelous light._

These are wonderful verses, in that they tell us we have been called into God’s light. However, they also show us that before we were born again, we were in a position of darkness. Thank the Lord, we have now been delivered from the domain of darkness.
