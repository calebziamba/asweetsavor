_"for we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God  
and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,"  
\-Philippians 3:3  
_

Young people may secretly think, “Young as I am, I already love Jesus so much. Surely the Lord will greatly use me!” They may feel assured of themselves, thinking they know which way to take, what they are doing, and having confidence that they can do it. Even if we are able to pass the first mountain, overcoming religion, we may still easily be trapped by the second, self-confidence. Until, like Paul, we have no confidence in the flesh, we will not be able to go beyond this second mountain. Oh, how we need to beware of the flesh!
