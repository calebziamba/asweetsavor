_Holding faith and a good conscience, which some have thrust away and thus become shipwrecked regarding the faith. â€” First Timothy 1:19_ Without a good conscience, we will not be able to follow the Lord, regardless of how gifted or talented we are. Although the functions of intuition and fellowship are important, our spirit is strong and joyful only when we live in unclouded union with the Lord. Therefore how buoyant and healthy our spirit is depends upon the condition of our conscience before God.
