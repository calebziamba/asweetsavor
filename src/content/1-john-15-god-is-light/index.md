This is an excerpt from the first message of the 2015 Labor Day Conference, held in Cleveland, Ohio. The topic of this conference was "God is Light."

The Bible text for this message was 1 John 1:3-5: "That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. And these things we write to you that your joy may be full. This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all." (NKJV)
