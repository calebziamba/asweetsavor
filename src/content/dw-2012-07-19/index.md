_In You, O Lord, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed; In Your righteousness deliver me. Incline Your ear to me, rescue me quickly; Be to me a rock of strength, A stronghold to save me. â€” Psalm 31:1-2_ We expect our Christian growth to proceed ever upward in a straight line, but our experience is full of ups and downs. When you are in a hard place, you should be encouraged, for it means you will soon be up. Likewise, when your Christian life is higher than ever before, be prepared, for you will soon experience a deeper down.

Over time, you will discover that the experience of being up and down is normal, for through it all you experience being one with Christ.
