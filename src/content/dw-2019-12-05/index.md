_“While the king sat at his table,_  
_My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.”_  
_– Song of Solomon 1:12, ASV_

This phrase, “My spikenard sent forth its fragrance,” should fill us with joy. Earlier the Shulammite said, “Your name is ointment poured forth” (1:4 NKJV). As we have seen, this indicates that our Lord is not only rich but is also processed. He became a man, suffered in His human living, shed His blood on the cross, was crucified, passed through death, and resurrected. He went to the cross and died for us. His work gives forth a fragrance, so that we can say of the Lord, “Your name is ointment poured forth.” At this point in her experience, however, the Shulammite can not only say, “Your name is ointment poured forth,” but also, “my spikenard sent forth its fragrance” for the king’s satisfaction, because she has become the result of His work. What a wonderful change is this!
