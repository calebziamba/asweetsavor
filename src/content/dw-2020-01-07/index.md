_“__Behold, I am with you and will keep you  
wherever you go, and will bring you back  
to this land; for I will not leave you until  
I have done what I have promised you”  
– Genesis 32:28  
_

The way God works is surprising. We expect God to punish us when we make a mistake. However, we don’t realize that when He disciplines, He comes to us with His promise and blessing. His presence has nothing to do with whether we are good or evil, crafty or simple. In spite of who we are or what we have done, He wants to freely give us His promise, blessing, and presence. When the Lord works on us, “He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness” (Heb. 12:10). Without God’s promise, blessing, and presence, none of us would be able to endure God’s work on us. We would collapse or try to escape.
