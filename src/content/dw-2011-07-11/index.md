_So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And the Lord said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!” Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah. — First Samuel 16:12-13_

When David was finally brought before them, Samuel saw that he was “ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking” (1 Sam. 16:12). The Lord told Samuel, “Arise, anoint him, for this is the one!” Therefore Samuel took the horn of oil he was commanded to bring and anointed David in the midst of his brothers. From that day forward, the Bible tells us that David had the Spirit of the Lord upon him (v. 13).
