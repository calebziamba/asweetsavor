_“Do not stare at me because I am black,_ _For the sun has burned me.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:6_

The statement, “For the sun has burned me,” indicates that her feeling of being black was caused by the Lord’s exposing. The light of the Lord shines like the sun, and you feel tender and exposed after He has done such a work; you can no longer dare to be proud. All who live in such a fellowship with the Lord will warn others not to take notice of them. When the Lord truly looks upon you, you will no longer care about others saying “Amen”; you will only live before the Lord, and you will see that you are responsible to Him alone.
