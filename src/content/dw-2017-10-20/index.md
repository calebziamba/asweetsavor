_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

Fearing God doesn’t mean we tremble in terror before Him. It means that we fear despising, depriving, or disobeying Him. Whatever God says, we do. Wherever God leads us, we follow.

This experience is so deep. It goes beyond our understanding. We hope to work for God and be useful in His hand, and in fact, the Lord may use us. However, if we are to be used by the Lord, we must fear God and be willing to give up our Isaac, the fruit of our work. We are to have nothing but God. Even the best gift God gives us will have to be offered as a sacrifice.
