_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

This joy and rejoicing issues from the enjoyment of grace. It is not tied to the ups and downs of our environment but to the Lord’s constant supply of grace. Paul and the Philippians were enjoying the reality of grace together. Grace descended from the throne in the heavens and came to the apostle Paul and to the church in Philippi. Grace became the source of joy and rejoicing among them.
