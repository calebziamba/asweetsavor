_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going._ _– Hebrews 11:8_

Once God appears to us, we begin to walk the way of the Lord, though, like Abraham, we may be unclear about where we are going. Living by faith according God’s calling is not what we imagine. Although it is beyond our thought and not very clear, it makes us walk. Because we have touched something real, we walk. If someone asks what we touched, we could not give a clear answer. This is God’s appearing, and it leads us to walk His way.
