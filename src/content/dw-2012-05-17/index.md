_"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’" Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me." — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

Initially you may not think that the fellowship of the watchmen fits you or is applicable to your situation, yet they actually do know your problem. They are spiritual men, who are able to discern all things and see through you. However, because you are still young in the Lord, you are not perceptive enough to receive the enlightenment until they leave.

Then suddenly you feel so clear and free. Finally, you have found the answer that really helps you. Your long toil and burden are past. Now the Lord is smiling upon you again. The winter is past and the spring has come. Everything is recovered. It is as sweet and attractive as before. Oh, what an enjoyment and rest!
