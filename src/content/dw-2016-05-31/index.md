_He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son._ _– Colossians 1:13_

Before we were saved our position was truly hopeless and miserable. We were in darkness, we were under the authority of Satan, we were in sin, and we were in death. We were under God’s judgment and therefore condemned. We were slaves to impurity and lawlessness, and we were children of wrath and sons of disobedience. As fallen and sinful human beings, we needed a change in our position. Now, as those who are born again, we have been delivered from our old position and all the negative things related to it, and transferred into a wonderful new position. Praise the Lord!
