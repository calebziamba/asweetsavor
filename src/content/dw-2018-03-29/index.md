_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

We may be proud of our accomplishments and tempted to boast in them, but can such bragging compare with Paul’s boast on the day of Christ? Paul counted all things according to their divine and eternal value (Phil. 3:4–8). He knew that nothing mattered except the accomplishment of God’s purpose. His boasting was based upon this, and for this he ran and toiled.
