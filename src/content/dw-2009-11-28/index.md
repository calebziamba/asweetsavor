_Peace be upon Israel! — Psalm 128:6b_

The psalmist concludes, “Peace be upon Israel.” When there are brothers in the church life who are as a vine and an olive tree, then there is peace.

We should pray, “Lord, I desire to grow and be transformed in such a healthy way. I want to know how to rest in You. I want to learn how to submit to Your arrangement for me. I pray eventually that there would be oil and wine within me. I pray that I could labor with blessing to the church.”

May the Lord have mercy on us that we would all become such a blessing!
