> But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

> Josh. 24:15 (ESV)

Brothers, we Jesus-lovers have a house, we have a car, and we have a beautiful, good family life. But we also have vision, and we realize everything is from Christ, in Christ, and unto Christ through the salvation of Jesus. So, we can easily tell the Lord, “Lord, everything I have is given to me by You, and everything I have is completely for You.” What a blessing.
