_When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things. — First Corinthians 13:11_ Many times Christians pick up spiritual activities as toys, for spiritual entertainment. Some even use the Bible to occupy themselves in this way. When they find something that interests them, they call it their “burden.” Our brother Witness Lee would sometimes say, “That is not your burden; that is your toy for your spiritual entertainment. You just like it because it fits you.” We must be careful, brothers and sisters. Our Christian life and activity must be for the glory of God.
