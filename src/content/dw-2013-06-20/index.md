_Slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful._ _– Romans 1:30-31_

The Lord has transfused into you a new nature that has nothing to do with your natural goodness or evil. You should treasure and guard the new nature so that it can grow well. You may have many problems with your nature, but the divine nature transforms you so that you don’t have to live in the fallen situation any more.

Romans 1:31 mentions some who are without affection. This is a fallen, unhealthy situation. Many brothers and sisters in the church life seem only to have divinity, but no humanity. This shows that they have not allowed the divine attributes to grow and form the new personality within them.
