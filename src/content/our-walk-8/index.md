> however, let’s keep living \[Gr. _stoicheō_\] by that same _standard_ to which we have attained. Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk \[Gr. _peripateō_\] according to the pattern you have in us.

> \-- Philippians 3:16-17 NASB

We all have attained to some measure of Christ according to our level of spiritual maturity. This measure becomes the rule that produces two aspects in our walk: the first (_stoicheō_) restricts us to the boundary of Christ as our unique goal; the second (_peripateō_) allows us the freedom to walk about within the sphere of this boundary. We experience both of these aspects in our walk as we pursue and gain Christ.
