_I recall your tears._  
_– 2 Timothy 1:4_

Many people seem to have no heart. I once read a novel in which one person was so hardened that he shed no tears even after taking advantage of another and causing him to go bankrupt. Some people have this kind of hardened heart. They only care about themselves and have no room in their heart for others.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 157.
