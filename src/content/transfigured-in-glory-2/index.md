> _And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory._
> 
> \- 1 Timothy 3:16, NKJV

This whole thing is so pure. This is the highest expression of a God-man – God manifested in the flesh in glory. But not just manifested in the flesh. Paul told Timothy, this is the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. But that’s godliness, here it says no, no, no, not just godliness, just God Himself. I’m God and when I’m fully expressed, let me tell you, it is all glory. God manifested in the flesh, but in glory!
