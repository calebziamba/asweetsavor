_“Awake, O north wind,_ _And come, wind of the south;_ _Make my garden breathe out fragrance,_ _Let its spices be wafted abroad._ _May my beloved come into his garden_ _And eat its choice fruits!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:16_

While the seeker is at the height of joy, she realizes three things.

First, she realizes she needs the north wind and the south wind. She knows, “When I am in such a marvelous condition, I have to go forward. For my going on, the Lord has to work on me more. O Lord, use every opportunity to work in me. Let the north wind (which is cold, bitter, and insufferable), and the south wind (which is warm, gentle, and comforting) come together upon me.”
