There was a certain good brother whom I loved dearly. I heard that one day while he was ministering, he was filled with the Spirit. Suddenly, he took off his jacket like Elijah and said he felt something in his body. He thought the Lord was going to take him up. One sister knelt before him and begged him not to leave. I even heard that more than one person knelt down in this way.

How could this happen among the churches? It was not because the brother was not eloquent. He must have been extremely eloquent, if people would kneel before him and ask him not to go. Not only was his speaking convincing, but his IQ was also very high. He did not have a problem with his spiritual revelation or vision. The problem was with his personality.
