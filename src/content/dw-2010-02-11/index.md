The mind, emotion, and will of those who seek fame are occupied in like manner with becoming famous. Their thoughts, feelings, and decisions are all focused on one goal—achieving fame. For example, a professor may be consumed with considering how to get his essay published, and in which journal, and so on.

In the Lord’s recovery we have a similar difficulty. If you meet a brother who does not know who you are, you may feel very disappointed. You may think in your heart, “Why does this brother not even know my name?” This proves you love fame.

The man who loves power is occupied with how to gain influence over others. In whatever group he is, he considers how to gain preeminence. This can also be true for someone within a local church.
