_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

We should use our time to pursue the Lord and enjoy Him. We should partake of Christ and allow Him to impart His life into us. We need not dwell on our weaknesses, saying, “I didn’t overcome today. I am so weak.” These are useless words. We must remember that we are the center of God’s plan. He is focusing on us to fulfill His desire, and it is our joy to cooperate with Him. This is the first thing the called heirs of God should know.
