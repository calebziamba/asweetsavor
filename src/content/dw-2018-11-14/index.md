As we shepherd others, our feeling should be, “Lord, only You can build the church. Only You can cause people to love You and consecrate themselves to You. Only You can draw people to pursue You. In spiritual things, I can only be Your co-laborer. I cannot generate a love for You in anyone.” To have this understanding is not a small thing.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 150.
