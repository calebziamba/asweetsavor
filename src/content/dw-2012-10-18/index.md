_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

Even if we have been following the Lord for a long time, we are in the same process as those who are newly saved. We don’t know how life will manifest itself, and we don’t know how life will operate. However, we should simply enjoy life and be filled with life. This is the second principle of being a seed.
