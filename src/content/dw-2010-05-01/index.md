_Boaz said, "Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it." So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went into the city. —Ruth 3:15_ Some brothers can only handle one meeting. Afterwards they feel so full that they must go to Starbucks for a break. The Lord must use many situations to enlarge us until our capacity to contain the Lord’s blessing grows. Then we will become a rich source of supply in the church life. As we mature, our ability to enjoy and receive what the Lord is pouring out becomes greater.

Adapted from [_Ruth: Growth Unto Maturity_,](/book-ruth/ "Go to the listing for this book.") pages 73-74.
