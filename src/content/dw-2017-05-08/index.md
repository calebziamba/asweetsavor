_The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him,  “Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward; for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever.”_ _– Genesis 13:14–15_

After giving this promise to Abraham, God next gave him the way to experience this divine promise:

_“Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you.”_ _– Genesis 13:17_
