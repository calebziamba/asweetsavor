_“As an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste." — Song of Songs 2:3_ The seeker’s need and experience begin with love and also end with love. This stage of her experience ends with increased enjoyment.

She mentions “my beloved among the sons.” The sons refer to all the things that capture one’s heart. Among so many things that are desirable and attractive, her beloved holds the first place in her heart.
