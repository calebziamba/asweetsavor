_Then behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.”_ _– Genesis 15:4_

God’s promises to Abraham were all related to the seed. Though God had promised Abraham a seed, the fulfillment of that promise did not come right away. Abraham told Him, “Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house \[Eliezer\] is my heir” (Gen. 15:3). God responded, “One who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir” (v. 4).
