Jacob heeded God’s word and left Laban to return to the land of his fathers. As he did so, the angels of God met him. When Jacob saw them he said, “This is God’s camp” (Gen. 32:2). He called the name of that place Mahanaim, which means two camps (Brown, p. 334). By this time, Jacob had grown out of the stage of bargaining with God. He realized that not only were the angels of God with him, but also God Himself was, and He would continue to be with him as his protection. Though he knew the God who protected him was powerful, he still didn’t trust Him or completely rely on Him. He felt he had to do something to help God. Therefore he said there were two camps: one was God’s and the other was his. God was in the heavens and he was on the earth. God was his protection and he was God’s help.

Jacob remembered Esau’s temper when he supplanted Esau’s blessing. It was because of Esau’s threat on his life that he had run away to Laban. Now as he was returning, he could not but worry and fear. He tried his best to solve his problem. He sent messengers to Esau, calling him lord. When the messengers returned they said, “We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him” (Gen. 32:6). It was obvious to Jacob that Esau meant to kill him. Yet rather than trust God, he still had his way to deal with the situation. His natural ability hadn’t come to an end. He divided the people, the flocks, the herds, and the camels into two camps. He said, “If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape” (v. 8). Then he sent Esau great presents to appease him.

Mahanaim—two camps—referred to God’s camp and Jacob’s camp. Now Jacob divided what he had into two camps and so produced another Mahanaim. It is amazing that a man who met God, knew God and obeyed God still didn’t trust God!

Sometimes when we rely on our natural ability, we share Jacob’s view of two camps without realizing it. Though we know God, His leading, and His protection, this does not seem to be enough. We feel we have to do something to help God. We think God needs our assistance. God works from the heavens, and we work on the earth. We know God is present, but we don’t trust Him. Although we know God protects us and has a camp, we would rather rely upon our natural ability, our own way, and our own camp. As long as we rely on our natural abilities, we won’t rely on God. As long as we have our ways, we don’t need God’s way.
