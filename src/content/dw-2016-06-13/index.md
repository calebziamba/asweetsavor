Before being born again, we were in death. Ephesians 2:1 says,

_You were dead in your trespasses and sins._

But when we were born again, we were made alive. Therefore, Ephesians 2:3â€“5 goes on to tell us,

_Among \[the unbelievers we\] all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ._
