_“I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.”_ _– Genesis 9:13_

This covenant between God and Noah began a new relationship between God and man. Before Noah, God had charged man, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth” (Gen. 1:28). However, He made no such demands in His covenant with Noah. No matter how corrupt man would become, God would find a way to fulfill His purpose.
