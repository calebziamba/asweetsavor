_It came about when he came near to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife...“Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may live on account of you.”_ _– Genesis 12:11,13_

Once Abraham arrived in Egypt, he lied to Pharaoh about his wife. When the lie was exposed, he was put to shame (vv. 11–20). God was merciful to Abraham and blessed him, even in his failure. When Abraham returned from Egypt, he was “very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold” (13:2). Because of the famine and his weakness, he went to Egypt and came back with blessings.
