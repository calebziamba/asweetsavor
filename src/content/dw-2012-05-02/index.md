_“Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.”_

_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.”

_

_— Song of Songs 2:17-3:1_

In the Song of Songs the Lord called the Shulammite to follow His way of the cross. He wanted her to experience His being put to shame, His suffering, His being despised, and His loneliness. But she thought the price was too high to pay. She didn’t realize that if she obeyed, the power of resurrection would uphold her and the heavenly strength would protect her. The grace of the Lord would supply her to follow Him.

Pitifully, she failed to obey at this crucial moment. Hence, she had to pay the severe penalty of the loss of the Lord’s presence. This is a painful experience for those who think they love Him with their whole heart.
