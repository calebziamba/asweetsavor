_So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. — Ruth 2:3_

Finding this field is one of the critical matters in our Christian life. Whether our Christian life is prevailing or not is largely determined by what field we have found. What is our field? It is the local church life. We should realize that this field is important, for it is mentioned by the three main people in chapter 2: by Ruth when she asks for Naomi's permission to glean in the field (v. 2), by Boaz when he tells Ruth not to go to another field (v. 8), and by Naomi when she reaffirms that Ruth should not glean in another field (v. 22).

The first mentioning of this field is our recognition of the Lord's arrangement that brought us to the field. The second mentioning is the Lord's confirmation that this is the proper field for us. The last mentioning is from those shepherding us; they reaffirm that this is the field where the Lord wants us to be. This field is the church life.
