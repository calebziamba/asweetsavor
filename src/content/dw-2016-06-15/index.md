Before we were born again we were in darkness, but now we are in the light. First Peter 2:9 says,

_You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for Godâ€™s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light._

Ephesians 5:8 says,

_You were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light._
