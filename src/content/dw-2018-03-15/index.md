The Lord says, in John 15:5,

_I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing._

When we were born again, we received the life of the vine and became part of that vine. Now we are one with Christ as the branches in the true vine, and thus receive the life of the vine and express all the riches of the vine.
