_Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to Him.” And she said, “Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad. — First Samuel 1:17-18_

Immediately after this, Hannah realized God had heard her and answered her prayer. She allowed herself to be encouraged, and indeed she did bear a son and named him Samuel, meaning “Asked of God” or “Heard of God.”
