_This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you._ _â€“ John 15:12_

We may feel that if I do something for you, and you do something for me, it means we love each other. However, that is actually a degraded, political kind of love, a love that merely involves the exchanging of favors. The love that exists among us should be a love that imparts life into one another, even as Christ loved us by dying for us and then imparting His life into us.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 99.
