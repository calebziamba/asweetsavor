Formerly we were in death, but by being born again we are set free from death. Romans 8:2 says,

_The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ,](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 54.
