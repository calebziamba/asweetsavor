_Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”_ _– John 14:6_

If the world is overpowering us, we should turn to enjoy Christ as life. If we are aware of something sinful or unhealthy in our life, we should turn to enjoy Christ as our life. The more Satan tries to upset our environment, the more we should enjoy Christ as our life.

Christ as our life is the answer! He is the supply to meet our needs. We should be able to say, “The life of Christ is nourishing me, strengthening me, supporting me, and enlightening me. I have all I need in His life!
