_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

The Lord reveals Himself to us according to the capacity of our vessels and according to the extent of our experience, but we must confess before the Lord that our vessels are too small; we are not able to contain all the blessing He desires to pour out upon us. May the Lord enlarge us and lead us to grow!

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 12.
