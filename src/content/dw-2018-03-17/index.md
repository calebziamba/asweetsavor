_“I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.”_ _– John 15:5_

We were not just born again as individuals, for in the vine, there are many branches. The more we enjoy Christ in all His riches for our daily life, the more we become part of the corporate expression of the body of Christ. This is to enjoy Christ as the true vine.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 95.
