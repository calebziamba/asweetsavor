_And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him in God. — 1 Samuel 23:16_

 

_Incline Your ear to me, rescue me quickly; Be to me a rock of strength, A stronghold to save me. — Psalm 31:2_ Strangely, though Saul in his zeal could not find David, somehow Jonathan could (1 Sam. 23:15–16). David had hidden himself in the woods, and Jonathan came to him. Eventually the men of Ziph told Saul that David was hiding among them (v. 19). By the time Saul prepared to come to Ziph, David had already moved to the wilderness of Maon. Though he pursued David and nearly trapped him in Maon, Saul heard that the Philistines were attacking Israel and had to leave (vv. 25–28).
