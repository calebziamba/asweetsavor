_“I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”_ _– Genesis. 15:1, NKJV._

After Abraham conquered the kings and returned, the Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, “I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.” Both the shield and the reward are actually God Himself. Without this understanding it is hard to follow the Lord and gain Him. We must realize that our strength, our gifts, and even our spiritual pursuit are nothing; God is everything. He is our inward reward and our outward shield. These two are closely related. Because of the shield without, we have the reward within, and the inward reward enlarges the outward shield.
