_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1_

If we are not gaining Christ, then all of our joy, sorrow, prosperity, and hardship are in vain. The purpose of God’s calling is for Him to be our portion. If we are gaining the Lord, all things have value. If not, all things are vain.
