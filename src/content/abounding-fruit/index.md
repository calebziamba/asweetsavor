> Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account
> 
> \- Philippians 4:17 NASB

Some say that the profit here is money—since the Philippians gave Paul money, the Lord would give them more  
money. My conscience has never allowed to me to interpret it this way. Instead, I believe that when the Philippians gave of their material supply, they gained Christ as their spiritual profit. This profit would abound to their heavenly account (Luke 12:33).
