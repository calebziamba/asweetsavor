_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

How can we become fragrant before the saints? It is by being perfumed with myrrh, frankincense, and all the fragrant powders of the merchant. Myrrh refers to the suffering and death of Christ, and frankincense refers to Christ’s resurrection. When we experience Christ’s death and resurrection, we will become fragrant with Christ’s death and resurrection.

His death and resurrection are fragrant. When we experience a variety of environments before the Lord while paying the price to experience Him in those environments, He as the Merchant will supply us with the precious spices of His death and resurrection, making us fragrant pillars of smoke in the church life.
