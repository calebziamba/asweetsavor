_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

Paul compared his labor among the Corinthians to that of a farmer, saying, “I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth” (1 Cor. 3:6). Whatever farmers gain can easily be lost if they do not maintain it. The thorns and thistles seem to pop up again as soon as they turn their backs. It is not easy. It requires wisdom and much labor.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 134.
