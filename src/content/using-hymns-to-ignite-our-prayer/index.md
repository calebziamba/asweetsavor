This sharing is taken from the second session of the [Jesus Lovers' Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/)

Brother Titus uses several hymns, including ["O, The Deep, Deep Love of Jesus" by Samuel Trevor Francis](https://hymnary.org/text/o_the_deep_deep_love_of_jesus) (Songs & Hymns of Life #206) and ["Here is Love Vast as the Ocean"](https://hymnary.org/text/here_is_love_vast_as_the_ocean) (Songs & Hymns of Life #200), to help the saints learn one thing: how to pray to the Lord in a very free way, just opening to Him concerning whatever matter is in their heart.
