_But the spiritual man discerns all things, but he himself is discerned by no one. For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ. â€” First Corinthians 2:15-16_ Brothers, be earnest about your spiritual awareness, for your spiritual growth will be determined by your spiritual awareness. How well you are able to minister and function will depend upon how spiritually keen you are.
