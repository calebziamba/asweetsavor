Christ is also the true freedom. In John 8:32 and 36, the Lord says,

_You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free....So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 93.
