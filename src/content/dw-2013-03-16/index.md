_Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.” Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the Lord is with you.” – Second Samuel 7:1-3_

After David spoke this word, God responded to him through Nathan the prophet, “I will set up your seed after you...and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father, and he shall be My son....And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever” (2 Sam. 7:12–14, 16). To David, this sounded almost too wonderful to be true.
