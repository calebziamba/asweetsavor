_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

Paul’s fourteen epistles are not chronologically arranged in the New Testament. Surely, our God had a purpose for this. In the order we have, Paul’s epistles begin with Romans and end with Hebrews. This order reveals certain arrangements and ideas, and shows us a pathway of Paul’s growth from Romans to Hebrews, culminating in his disappearance from the book of Hebrews. This characteristic of Hebrews indicates a maturity in life and reveals how much Christ had grown and been magnified in Paul. Yet this process had a solid base—the book of Romans.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, pages 6-7.
