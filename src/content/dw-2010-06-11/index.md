_And all those who believed were together and had all things common. â€” Acts 2:44_

The impressive thing about the first local church is the fact that the brothers and sisters were in one accord. Even though the Jews who were saved on the day of Pentecost were from different countries and backgrounds, the Spirit was able to subdue every difference and even grant them the desire to have all things in common.
