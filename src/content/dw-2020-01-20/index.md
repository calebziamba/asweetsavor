_“Now \[Jacob\] arose that same night and took his two wives and his two maids  
__and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. He took them and  
sent them across the stream. And he sent across whatever he had. Then Jacob  
was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.  
\-Genesis 32:22-24_

Jacob didn’t foresee this wrestling experience but God did. When Jacob had exhausted all his own efforts at self-preservation, God came to wrestle with him. God wrestles with us like He wrestled with Jacob. This wrestling deals with the basic problem of our growth in life.
