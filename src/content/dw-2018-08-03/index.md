_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Salvation by life has three important aspects discussed in Romans: sanctification (5:12–8:13), glorification (8:14–39), and transformation (12:1–15:13). The introduction to these three aspects is the phrase in 5:10: “saved by His life.”

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 15.
