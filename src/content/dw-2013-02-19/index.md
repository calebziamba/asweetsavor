_“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse;_ _A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:12_

There were only God and man in the Garden of Eden. In like manner, there are only God and man in you. As you stand in Christ’s ascension, you are to the Lord a garden that is fragrant, fresh, and full of life. The Lord can tell you, “When I come to you, when I look at you, and when I fellowship with you, I feel that My purpose for creating man is achieved. Indeed I have gained My garden.”
