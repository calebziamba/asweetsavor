_But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition._  
_– Philippians 2:19_

Paul expected to be encouraged by Timothy’s good report concerning the Philippians. In verse 19, the Greek word for “encouraged” is _eçpsuchéô_ (Strong, no. 2174), a compound of two Greek words (_eu_ and _psuché_) literally meaning “good soul.” Timothy’s report would encourage Paul and give him a good state of soul.
