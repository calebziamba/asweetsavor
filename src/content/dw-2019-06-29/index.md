_“Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

What marks a virgin is that she loves the Lord  
rightly, meaning her love is without any other wish,  
expectation, or condition. Thus, a true virgin follows  
the Lord without any condition, serves the Lord  
without any condition, and lives in fellowship with  
the Lord without any condition.  
  
To her, joy cannot replace the Lord Himself; even  
the Lord’s very presence cannot replace the Lord  
Himself. Such a virgin is so obedient to love the Lord  
that she has no request for anything. Besides the  
Lord, she desires nothing else, and she loves nothing  
else.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, pages 30-31.
