_“Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name.”_ _– Genesis 11:4_

The building of the Tower of Babel exposed the rebellious nature of man. The people of the earth thought, “It is all right that God is the Lord and King, but we also want to make a name for ourselves. We want to have our portion just as God has His.” This is rebellion.
