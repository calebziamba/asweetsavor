> I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.
> 
> \- Matthew 16:18

This is a big statement. If you ask the Lord, “Lord, what are You doing?” He says, “I am building the church.” “Why did You save me?” “For the building of the church.” “Why did You save us all?” “For the building of the church.” “For two thousand years, why did You gain so many Jesus lovers willing to give everything to You?” He says, “Not just for me, but for the building up of My church.” You know, brother, we need a revelation of Christ. We also need a revelation to see the church. From God, we know Christ. From Christ, we should know the church. “Upon this rock, I will build My church.”
