_“My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of En-gedi.” — Song of Songs 1:14_

Henna flowers are not overly conspicuous, but among the green leaves of a vineyard they are able to stand out. “My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers” can be interpreted to mean, “I treasure my Lord in my heart, and He is so beautiful to me.”

En-gedi is a place in the wilderness to which David fled to find shelter from Saul. According to Watchman Nee, “En-gedi” means “the fountain of the lamb.” When we are waiting for the Lord and experiencing His death, on the one hand, He is our shelter, and on the other hand, He is our fountain of life in the wilderness. How should we live upon this earth today? Our living should be completely in the Lord. On the one hand, He is our fountain and life supply—He quenches our thirst and takes care of our needs. On the other hand, the Lord is our shelter—we can trust in Him in any situation. When there is a difficult environment, we can hide ourselves in Him. What matters is not our strength, but that we can hide in Him and experience Him as our fountain, as our life supply.
