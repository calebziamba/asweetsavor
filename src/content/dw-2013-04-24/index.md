_For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come._ _– First Thessalonians 1:9-10_

After we have Christ’s headship, as seen in Colossians, we wait for His return. This is described in the next group of Paul’s epistles—1 and 2 Thessalonians.
