_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

We should use every ounce of blessing the Lord gives us as our asset. If the Lord gives us one couple, we should labor with them as our companions to gain a third couple. Paul labored in such a way in Philippi, and his expectation was that he would be able to boast that his labor among them was not in vain.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 134.
