_Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”_ _– John 14:6_

Many times we know what should be true in our Christian life, but it is not real to us. We know that as Christians we should be dynamic, powerful, and energetic. We know we should be joyful, cheerful, and excited. We know all these things, but we just can’t be these things.

Have you ever had this experience? Why aren’t we able to be what we know we’re supposed to be? It is because we are short of the enjoyment of Christ as life. Only Christ as life can meet our daily needs.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 86.
