During the process of Christian growth, you should learn to escape from the ungodly things. Take card games for example. Playing cards is not a sin, but it will cause you to lose your fear of God and your life of godliness. Card games are not sinful things, but playing them takes away your godliness. In principle, you shouldn’t touch anything related to winning or losing, and you shouldn’t touch anything related to probability. If two brothers play chess, one wins and the other loses, and there will not be a smooth feeling between them. Another example is the lottery. Buying lottery tickets is gambling. It takes away your fear and godliness. In order to cultivate a good personality, you must fear God.
