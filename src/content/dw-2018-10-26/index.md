If we have coworkers who are impossible, we should praise the Lord. When people seem to waste our time, we should praise the Lord. We are surrounded by people the Lord uses to test us. Achieving approvedness is not easy. In every situation, the Lord is there, especially in our hardships and failures.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 147.
