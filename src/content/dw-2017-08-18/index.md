_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

God’s desire is the church. It is the center of His will. Although we are for the church, it is not in our hands. God’s promise, appearing, calling, and leading are all for the church. Just as Abraham walked through the land which didn’t belong to him, we live in the church life, yet the church is not a work or possession in our hands.

With this understanding we can declare, “Lord, I can gain nothing but You in my life. You are my only reward. I am willing to give everything for the church but I don’t need to have any position in the church. The church is not my work. Although I am willing to give my life for the church, the church is not under my control. It belongs to You.” This lesson is not easy to learn.
