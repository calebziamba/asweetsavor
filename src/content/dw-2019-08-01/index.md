_“If you yourself do not know,_ _Most beautiful among women,_ _Go forth on the trail of the flock_ _And pasture your young goats_ _By the tents of the shepherds.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:8_

The Lord answers her prayer by calling her the “most beautiful among women,” and telling her that she should “go forth on the trail of the flock,” or “follow in the footsteps of the flock” (NKJV). The Lord takes care of her according to her concern in her condition. Every time we come to the Lord in this way, He seems encouraged and moved by our predicament and sees us as the “most beautiful among women.” The Lord knows where we are, and He understands our complaint: “I have kept other’s vineyards, but my own I have not kept, and I don’t know where to pasture my young goats.” He knows that our not knowing what to do is because of our love for Him. He also knows that outwardly we are weak and self-centered, but inwardly we are, nonetheless, still lovely to Him. Therefore He says, “You are the fairest among women, and everything is fine. If you do not know, go forth in the footsteps of the flock.” The Lord doesn’t mention anything about our work in His response. When we love the Lord, we are easily occupied with our work, and we want to do something for Him. His desire, however, is to save those who love Him from such work.
