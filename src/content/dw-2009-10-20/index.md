Your mind and spirit should also be in harmony as you minister. If your spirit is prompting you to say a certain thing, and your mind is somewhere else, your spirit and mind will not be in harmony, and your words will lose their anointing.

Your spirit is released through your mind. You must use your mind to find the appropriate utterance and then release these words with your spirit. Therefore if you want to see that your burden is released, your spirit and your mind must work together.
