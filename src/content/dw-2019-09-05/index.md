_When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home. - Genesis 25:27_

God not only calls but also has boundless grace. Only God could be so gracious to Jacob. Jacob never wanted God but just the things God could give him. He wanted the birthright, so he struggled in his mother’s womb and held his brother’s heel (Gen. 25:24–26; 27:36). Then he sold red stew to his brother Esau for the birthright (25:29–34) and tricked his father into blessing him instead of Esau (27:1–29). We would never dream that someone pursuing things from God would behave like this. A person can seem spiritual yet have no desire for God.
