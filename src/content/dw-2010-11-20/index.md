_Now in those there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. — Judges 21:25_

_And when He had deposed Saul, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will. — Acts 13:22_ Why would God call such a group of senseless people? Yet even in the midst of this era of the judges, God still kept a few, such as Ruth and Boaz, the great-grandparents of David, who shined before Him. May the Lord cause us to realize how much we need to be freed from all religious concepts and practices so we may simply and purely care for the Lord’s heart. Everything around us may be dark and seemingly hopeless, but if we remain pure toward God and inquire of Him what He desires, God can yet have a way to gain what He is after.

This is the environment that led to David. How precious that on the earth, even in the midst of such darkness and confusion and in spite of his own flaws and weaknesses, David realized God desired something and sought out His heart. Because of this one man, an entire generation was brought into God’s blessing.
