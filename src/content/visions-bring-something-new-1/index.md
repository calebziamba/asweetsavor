> \- Luke 1:18

If you were Zacharias, how would you respond? The Bible says he kneels down, so his first response should be to praise the Lord and say "Hallelujah! You have told me something new; I see something new," but that didn't happen. His question is, "How can this be?"

I have been in the Church in Cleveland, I’ve been in church meetings, for 20 years. If an angel really came to say something to me, my answer would be "How can this be?" I’m so used to it now. I’m accustomed to it. This is my custom. This is what I’m doing every day, every week. I come to the meeting, I see the brothers and say "Hi" to them. I even have love feasts with them and we even listen to the message, we have fellowship and we go home and wait for another seven days.

What is that? That is a custom. We need revelations. We need visions.
