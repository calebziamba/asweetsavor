_“Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like columns of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant? Behold, it is the traveling couch of Solomon; Sixty mighty men surround it, Of the mighty men of Israel.” — Song of Songs 3:6_

Now His seeker has become His rest, constituted with His element and coordinated with others who know how to fight for the Lord’s interest (represented by the 60 mighty men who surround the king’s bed in the night). She has also become His vehicle for His move (represented by Solomon’s palanquin). In her, the Lord has someone through whom He can act and carry out His desire among men.

Those who have become the Lord’s bed and palanquin have lost their opinion and even their feeling about what should be. Instead, those who bear the Lord are constructed with “posts of silver” (3:10), meaning that their mind, emotion, and will have experienced the effect of redemption.
