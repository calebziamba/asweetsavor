_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

If you desire to serve the Lord, then you must be a seed. If you are ready and willing to serve Him, then the first thing the Lord will say to you is, “Are you really willing to serve Me? Are you prepared? If so, I am digging the hole for you right now, so that I can bury you. You are a good seed, so I’m going to dig very deep. Are you ready? Then jump in! From now on there is no more ‘you.’”

What is this? This is to serve the Lord. If you want to know the secret of how to serve the Lord effectively, then this is the first thing. You must be ready to disappear; you must be ready to die; and you must be ready to be buried.
