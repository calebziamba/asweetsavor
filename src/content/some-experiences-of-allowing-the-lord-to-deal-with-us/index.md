By allowing the Lord to work on us, we will find that eventually we produce the bulbs and blossoms pictured in the hammered work of the lampstand. In this excerpt, brother Titus Chu looks at how the Lord worked in the biblical life of Jacob, then goes on to recount some of his own experiences of how the Lord performs this "hammering work" in our lives.

This excerpt is taken from the July 2016 Summer Vision Week training in Cleveland, OH. This training was focused on the Golden Lampstand of the Tabernacle, as described in Exodus chapter 25.
