> Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
> 
> \- Joshua 1:9

He is with us all the time, all the day, and on all the practical matters. Wherever you are He's with you. But, suppose the presence of the Lord is gone? So what should you do? Be covered with His presence.
