We need to realize that as God-created human beings, we have a human spirit. In fact, it is in our human spirit that we were born again. In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus Himself tells us,

_That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 72.
