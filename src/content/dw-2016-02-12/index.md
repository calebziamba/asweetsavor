Before we were born again, we were in sin. Romans 3:23 says,

_All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God._

This is true of every human being. Romans 3:10 says,

_As it is written, “There is none righteous, not even one.”_

In our former position, we may have had no feeling about the many things we did that were unrighteous. We offended God all the time, even though we may not have realized it. We not only committed sins, but we were dwelling in sin and abiding in sin. Our entire life was just in sin.
