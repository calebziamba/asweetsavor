_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ._ _– Philippians 3:8_

Of all Paul’s epistles, Philippians is a unique book. It tells us that Christ is our goal, our living, the source of our existence, and the reason we are alive. It shows us that Christ is our Savior and Sustainer. He is everything to us for the sake of our spiritual progress. We should pursue nothing but Christ. As we pursue Christ together, our life becomes full of meaning.
