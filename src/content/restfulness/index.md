> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
> 
> – Philippians 4:6 (NASB)

When we come to a major turn in our lives, often we become nervous, wondering, “What should I do next?” We begin to consider, “If I do this or that, will others be happy with me?” How quickly we lose our restfulness! Why do we experience anxiety? Because we do not touch the Lord “by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving” (v. 6). Only those who enjoy Christ have real peace.
