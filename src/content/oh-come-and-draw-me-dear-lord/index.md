**Chorus**:  
Oh, come and draw me dear Lord  
That in You I would grow up fully  
There's nothing I can depend on  
Besides growing wonderfully

1. Growing in Your life  
    That through me You’re expressed  
    I would match You in all  
    All that you are, heavenly One  
    Your death! Crucifixion!  
    Resurrection! Grow full in me  
    Your divine Self, be formed in me  
    This is my heart’s yearning  
      
    
2. Growing in Your love  
    You Yourself who are love  
    Fully enjoying You  
    You are love, You are love  
    Divine, heavenly love  
    Flowing from You, watering me  
    You who are love, grow full in me  
    This is my heart’s yearning  
      
    
3. Growing in Your riches  
    O, You are heavenly  
    You dispense from above  
    Heaven’s supply, supplying me  
    Divine treasure You are  
    Enjoying You, all of my life  
    Manifesting, heaven’s riches  
    This is my heart’s yearning  
      
    
4. In my heart is this plea  
    All my spirit desires  
    From the depths of my being  
    That in me, You would be King  
    Be King, King in my heart  
    Joined with my Lord, mingled with You  
    Growing until I’m one with You  
    This is my heart’s yearning
