_Giving thanks to the Father...who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. â€” Colossians 1:12a-13_

Formerly we were poor, hopeless sinners in a miserable and desperate position. But now we have nothing to do with where we were before; God has transferred us into an entirely new position!

Now that we are born again, we are no longer in darkness. We are no longer under the authority of Satan. We are no longer in sin, and we are no longer in death. We are no longer under God's judgment, and we are no longer condemned. We are no longer slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness, and we are no longer children of wrath and sons of disobedience. Now we have nothing to do with where we were before. We have been completely transferred out of our former position by being born again.
