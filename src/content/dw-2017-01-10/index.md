_You are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household._ _– Ephesians 2:19_

We were born again not only to be individual vessels, but also to be God’s temple, to be members of the body of Christ, and to be fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God.
