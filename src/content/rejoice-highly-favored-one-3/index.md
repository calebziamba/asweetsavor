> And having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, highly favored _one,_ the Lord _is_ with you; blessed _are_ you among women!”
> 
> \- Luke 1:28, NKJV

The angel says “highly favored one.” God has a lot of blessings. God is rendering the great blessings _to you_. God renders the great blessing to you. What is that? You are a favored one. How do you know you are favored? Because you have gained what the other people cannot gain.
