_Then behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.”_ _– Genesis 15:4_

Since Sarah was so old and barren, she thought it was impossible for this promise to be fulfilled through her, so she told Abraham to take her maid, Hagar, and have a son through her (16:2). Abraham listened to his wife and produced Ishmael (v. 15). When God again appeared, Abraham said to Him, “Oh that Ishmael might live before You!” (17:18). God answered, “No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac” (v. 19).
