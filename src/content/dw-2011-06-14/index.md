_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

Previously in Psalm 131 he had been brought to a quiet restfulness. Yet now he is determined not to go up to his bed. Instead of finding rest he is desperate for God’s house. He would say, “I see the dwelling place of God. I am for God’s house and God’s testimony. My house and God’s house are the same. Because of this, I forbid myself to have any rest! I am burdened! I am charged! I am desperate! Oh Lord, You have a tabernacle, but where is the substance? Where is the reality of Your testimony?”
