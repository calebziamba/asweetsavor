_Now you are Christ’s body, and individually members of it._ _– 1 Corinthians 12:27_

Our new life in the body of Christ can be demonstrated by looking at our own physical body. When we look at our physical body, we realize that God is truly wise. Only He could put things together in such a wonderful way, so perfect in every detail. Every part of our body is fully coordinated with every other part. Every member has its particular function, yet all the members function together as one body.
