_But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak and not to please ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor with a view to what is good for building up. â€” Romans 15:1-2_ The mind of Christ is that each of us should not please ourselves, but instead, we who are strong should bear the weaknesses of the weak.

Do not talk about what others do. In the church life, we should not talk about who has been to the theater and who has not been to the theater. We should only care for Christ. Instead of talking about others, we should read the Bible together, enjoy some riches together, and pray together. By our nurturing, all the other things would disappear. We would only know the Lord Jesus Christ.
