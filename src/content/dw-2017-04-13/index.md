_Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord._ _– Genesis 12:8_

God’s provision for us in the good land eventually brings us to His house (“Bethel,” which means “House of God”) so that we may experience all His riches. Just as those without a house cannot have a healthy living, those without the church life cannot have a healthy spiritual walk in the way of God.
