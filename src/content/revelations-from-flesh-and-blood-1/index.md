> Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal _this_ to you, but My Father who is in heaven."
> 
> \- Matthew 16:16-17

Here the Lord says “Simon Barjona, I tell you, this is not revealed by flesh and blood.” Why? Flesh and blood don’t give you the real stuff. “Flesh and blood can bring forth revelations which are attractive and right, but are of no value...” It has no value. You look at it, it seems right, but no, there’s no value. Thus it leads to different perceptions and different acknowledgements.
