> "But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter."

> \- Romans 7:6

\[In Luke 1\] The angel told him \[Zacharias\] that he was made mute “because you did not believe my words.” So Zacharias surely began to consider: “I do believe in God. I’m a priest. I’m serving God, aren’t I? I’ve been serving God all of my life. I’m going to be a retired priest. Now, how could the angel say I don’t believe? This belief must be something new. It’s not the belief I used to think of. In my old belief I am sinful, so I offer a sin offering; I have problems, so I offer a trespass offering; I don’t live properly, so I offer a meal offering. Now, I am beginning to realize it is more than just, ‘I have a situation and I offer something.’ Now, I am starting to see something.”
