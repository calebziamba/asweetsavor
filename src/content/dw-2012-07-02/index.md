 _Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. He came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave. The men of David said to him, "Behold, this is the day of which the Lord said to you, 'Behold; I am about to give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'" Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly. — 1 Samuel 24:2-4_

After we realize the Lord is with us, we will begin to view our persecutors differently. We will no longer fear them as before.

Saul returned to his search for David at En Gedi after fighting the Philistines. He entered alone into a cave to attend to his needs, not knowing that David and his men were hiding there. As David looked upon him, Saul did not look so mighty. David had been running from Saul, fearing him as a mighty king. Now, however, Saul looked weak and vulnerable. While Saul was in this condition, David secretly cut off a corner of his robe (1 Sam. 24:1–4).
