_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose._ _â€” Philippians 2:2_

The secret of living the body life is to focus only on Christ. When anything else is being exalted, whether a person, a practice, or a teaching, the reality of the body of Christ disappears. Even when we make the oneness of the body our focus, we are in danger of losing this oneness by making it an issue.
