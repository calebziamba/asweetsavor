_\[Timothy\] was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium._  
_– Acts 16:1-2  
  
_Approvedness begins in our local church and with the churches nearby. This was the case with Timothy. Two churches appreciated and respected him. He was from Lystra, but the churches in both Lystra and Iconium recommended him.
