> For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of Godâ€™s mystery, which is Christ.
> 
> \- Colossians 2:1-2 (ESV)

"In this universe, there is something so profound, so high. I would use the word "mystery"... There is something hidden in God with the highest value. There's something hidden in God as the sole treasure. Who is that person? Jesus Christ Himself."
