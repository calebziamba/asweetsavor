The Divine Mystery, Titus Chu  
#373 in _Songs and Hymns of Life_

Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice! 

This hymn bubbles over with Joy! It is one of Brother Titus’ most buoyant and infectious songs. The words paired with a stirring tune bring the singer into the experience of the Holy Spirit it describes. In fact, this hymn is full of terms and teachings about the Holy Spirit, but they are not left on the page as cold doctrines. They come alive, rise off the page and become ours as we sing them! This is one of the singular traits of the author’s ministry—bringing us into the experience of the terms and truths in the Bible.

Let’s sing through the song and be brought into its buoyancy!  

> **Verse 1**  
> Oh! Let us sing joyfully.  
> Sing an unveiled mystery  
> We enjoy the realm of the Spirit now  
> The divine and mystical reality.  
> Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice!  
> This divine mystery!  
> We enjoy the realm of the Spirit now  
> The divine and mystical reality.

A Christian has access to a joyful life in the Spirit! The Spirit is not just a “come and go” feeling or influence, but He is like a realm or a broad plane for you to live in. Now I will not define or try to unpack every term used in this song, like “[mystical realm](https://www.asweetsavor.org/reality-of-the-divine-and-mystical-realm/?fbclid=IwAR1b0ui5jkAcmC_OYKszdLzeWXW4kJYDwrg-18eCfNP4PXw8je-DSeaWaXE)”, “[organically](https://www.asweetsavor.org/fj-sep-13-03/?fbclid=IwAR0i7yTva5uBZwbm5RSJp0YXQviWo6H5mq1vnsaDz09BbLGtqMwEtmnbJXI)” or “[constituted](https://www.asweetsavor.org/a-religious-living-versus-spiritual-reality/?fbclid=IwAR1TiePGaoBgWECrEIDACAwmRVHcSrEvT_B2Q93CJ-gnE9lFjNkJRmw9Tz8)”, but the author has a lot of great content on this website digging into those concepts in the Bible. A metaphor explaining the Spirit as a realm is a pair of glasses for a nearsighted person. The glasses let the person see the detail and beauty of the world around them.  The facts of their life might not change, but everything is richer, clearer and their true meaning can be seen. This is what life living in the realm of the Spirit is like! So to turn the key and unlock this song, sing it full-heartedly, and let the Spirit show you what it means to know and be filled with Him in every aspect of your walk throughout this realm!

> **Verse 2**  
> Oh! You are the Spirit, Lord,  
> in my spirit one with me.  
> When I touch the life-giving Spirit now  
> I am one with You and You are one with me.  
> Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice!  
> in the Spirit of life.  
> When I touch the life-giving Spirit now  
> I am one with You and You are one with me.

This is the spring of the song. Now that we are born again, we experience the Lord as the Spirit being one with our spirit. And this joint spirit, this oneness with the Lord, brings to us all of His virtues and life when we turn to and touch Him with our spirit. This is the divine mystery of the Christian Life! We are one with the very Triune God and can tap into all His person, Life-giving vitality and virtues when we pray, sing, and walk in the Spirit of Truth. When we are doing this, it is so easy to be caught up in the joy with which this song overflows. Oh, enjoy! This causes you to leap—sing and rejoice! When we touch the life-giving Spirit now, we are one with our God and He is one with us! Praise the Lord for this marvelous fact and daily experience!

I have been energized by this joyful Spirit many times while I’m in the car. Sometimes my turning to the Lord starts slowly; other times He draws me strongly to redeem that time by being with Him. Through prayer, calling on His name and singing, that feeling in my spirit becomes stronger and stronger until I am so filled with Him that I view my whole life from His heavenly perspective. I am one with Christ! I am living on this earth for the advancement of the Gospel energized by His Living Spirit! What a life is this. I sometimes even shout a Hallelujah! ...But then I need wisdom to keep both hands on the steering wheel and to not get too carried away!

This experience of being enlivened by just a touch of the Spirit within is the key to the entire process of redemption. This is how we are cleansed, saved, renewed, transformed and eventually conformed into the image of Christ, the Son of God! It is an organic process, furthered and brought into our lives by this simple marvelous touching of the Spirit in our spirit. The next few verses rejoice at these facts and use many of the terms above. Enjoy them! Even if you don’t quite understand them, rejoice and enjoy them! The Spirit of Truth will bring you into their reality. 

> **Verse 3**  
> Oh! I’m saved organically,  
> growing to maturity.  
> Now from sin, the world, and the self I’m free  
> In the Spirit who is sanctifying me.  
> Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice  
> Sanctify thoroughly;  
> Now from sin, the world and the self I’m free  
> In the Spirit who is sanctifying me.

> **Verse 4**  
> Oh! In spirit we’re transformed,  
> to the Son we are conformed.  
> He’s the resurrected, surpassing One;  
> Who is formed and constituted within me.  
> Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice!  
> To the Son we’re conformed.  
> He’s the resurrected, surpassing One;  
> Who is formed and constituted within me.

> **Verse 5**  
> I’m becoming one with Him,  
> And His glory shines within.  
> From a vessel rough, comes a life refined,  
> And His life is shining out for all to see  
> Oh! Enjoy! Sing! Rejoice!  
> Oh this life! Glorious!  
> From a vessel rough, comes a life refined,  
> And His life is shining out for all to see.

When we touch the Spirit, we realize we are one with our Lord. However, there is also a process of growth in this oneness that the full arc of this divine mystery produces. As we live again and again in the Spirit, we are becoming one with Him! And His glory shines more and more from within us. If we are faithful to this key to full salvation, we will look back on all the stages of growth in our life, all the experiences the Lord brought us through, and realize that though we were once a rough vessel, now a refined, transformed life shines through us for all to see. This causes us to overflow with joy unspeakable as we obtain the outcome of our faith, the salvation of our souls (1 Peter 1:9).
