_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_ _– John 1:29_

_You are My friends if you do what I command you._ _– John 15:14_

How do we enjoy Christ? We enjoy Him as the Lamb; all our sins are taken away. We enjoy Him as our Friend; we can tell Him all our problems. We enjoy Him as our older Brother; we are going to be the same as He is. We enjoy Him as the good Shepherd; He is the trustworthy, sovereign One who arranges every step of our lives. We enjoy Him as the Builder; He is building us into His body and into the practical church life. And we enjoy Him as our Bridegroom; we are going to marry Him. Oh, we have such a wonderful Christ!
