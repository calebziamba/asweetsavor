_And Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech._ _– Genesis 5:25_

Lamech means “the wild man” (Easton). How could a faithful man who is waiting for the Lord’s coming be a wild man? God wants a wild Lamech—not the Lamach in the line of self but the Lamech in the line of life who is beside himself for God’s will.
