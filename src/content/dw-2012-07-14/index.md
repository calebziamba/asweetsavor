_She fell at his feet and said, “On me alone, my lord, be the blame. And please let your maidservant speak to you, and listen to the words of your maidservant.” — First Samuel 25:24_

Abigail’s understanding was marvelous. Though David was still intent on killing Nabal, Abigail stated that the Lord had held him back from shedding blood by sending her to him.

Then she offered David the food she had brought and said, “The Lord will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord fights the battles of the Lord....It shall come to pass, when the Lord...has appointed you ruler over Israel, that this will be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself” (1 Sam 25:28, 30, 31).
