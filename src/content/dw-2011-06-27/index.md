_And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers, for the equipping of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. â€” Ephesians 4:11-13_ How is this oneness transmitted to us? It is transmitted by the one unique ministry, by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers (Eph. 4:11-12). This one ministry is so rich that it requires four categories of gifted members to carry it out. What all the ministers in this New Testament ministry produce is the oneness of the faith (Eph. 4:13).

Over a period of 44 years, I saw how Witness Lee endeavored to produce this oneness. Over the ages, the ministers who carry this New Testament ministry have labored to transmit the faith into the believers so they could become joined to the Lord and to one another, and so they could grow until they together would become a full grown man. In this way, all the believers will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
