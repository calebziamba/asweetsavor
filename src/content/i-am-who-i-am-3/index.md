> God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”

> – Exodus 3:14, NASB

So you talk about His being. What kind of person is this? He is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent. This means He’s always there, He knows everything, and He’s always with His power. Always. Do you realize that there is such a God who rules the universe? You ask Him, “Who are You?” He says, “I am who I am,” or, “I am that I am. I am always here. I know everything here. I always have power over everything here.” What a glorious, marvelous God.
