_But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak and not to please ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor with a view to what is good for building up. — Romans 15:1-2_

One accord is totally a matter of our inward exercise, and not our outward action. It is for our brothers’ profit and building up, while we patiently wait for their growth.

It is critical that we see the need of substantiating the riches the Lord has given to us from Watchman Nee and Witness Lee. Even so, we should not make an issue of these riches, but instead patiently wait. We should labor, feed, nourish, and nurture the saints until we all can attain with some riches of Christ constituted into us.
