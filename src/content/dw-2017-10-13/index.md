_He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering.”_ _– Genesis 22:2_

Abraham obeyed God. However, when he was about to slay Isaac on the altar, the angel of the Lord said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me” (v. 12).
