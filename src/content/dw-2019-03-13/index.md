_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

We should desire this father-child relationship, yet there is no need for us to shop around for a father or child. The Lord has set each of us in the right place to develop (1 Cor. 12:18). He has arranged our circumstances.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 160.
