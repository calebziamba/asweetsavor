_To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours. — First Corinthians 1:1_

According to the Bible there are only local churches, which together represent the Body of Christ. This Body is constituted with all the believers who have lived since the church began. How grand, broad, and glorious this is! We have to thank the Lord for such a marvelous reality. In this stage of His recovery we are those who can pray, “Lord, raise us up and build us together in our local church. We are one with You, and we are one with Your economy. We are one with all the local churches for the Body of Christ!”
