_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. —Philippians 2:16_

_It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel._ _—Philippians 1:7_

Paul’s running was not just for himself; it was for the body of Christ. His running brought others onward. As he pursued Christ, others became partakers with him of grace (Phil. 1:7).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 133.
