In the beginning of our Christian life our growth seemed fast. Later, it was not as outwardly evident, yet our knowledge of the Lord should always be fresh. It is not enough that we bring people to Christ and raise them up. We should always ask, “Is the Spirit testifying Christ to me and leading me? Is the Lord in me different?”
