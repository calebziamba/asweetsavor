Once I was with some churches that were going through a great trial. I was asked if I thought these churches would begin to separate from one another. I found it difficult to identify with the thought behind the question, for the biblical view is that local churches are not connected organizationally, so they cannot be divided in that sense.

If we surrender to organization, we shall live for an institution rather than for Christ and His church. Anything that goes beyond Christ and the local churches will result in casualties, for people will fight over Christian work and orthodoxy.
