_Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord; O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? — Psalm 130:1-3_

The realization of who we are should not bring us under condemnation. The Lord’s light should cause us to trust in the Lord’s forgiveness (Psalm 130:4). We should not overly dwell on our sinfulness, but on the Lord’s salvation.

This verse shows us something that the more the Lord forgives us, the more we fear Him. We should not think that enjoying the Lord’s forgiveness will lead us to be loose and careless in our behavior. Actually, the more the Lord forgives us the more we are afraid to sin again. Our experience of forgiveness makes us very sensitive to the Lord. We develop a godly fear, because we do not want to offend Him.
