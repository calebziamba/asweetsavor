_Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. — Song of Songs 4:4, KJV_

Here the Lord says the seeker neck is an “armory.” This shows that she exercises her will to prepare for the spiritual warfare. The fact that “A thousand bucklers hang on it, all the shields of the mighty men,” refers to her preparedness against Satan’s attack.

Brothers and sisters, Satan will not usually attack us by means of sin, for we are sensitive concerning sin. Satan tries to get us to leave our proper standing under the Lord’s authority, for then he can surely defeat us.
