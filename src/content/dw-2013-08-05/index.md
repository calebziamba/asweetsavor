_“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;_ _I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam._ _I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;_ _I have drunk my wine and my milk._ _Eat, friends;_ _Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:1_

Brothers and sisters, if your locality seems dysfunctional, probably there is none among you who has become like the Shulammite in these verses. If in your locality there is much enjoyment of the Lord and the Lord has a way to go on, it is likely because at least a few among you are like this Shulammite. Some are experiencing this life union with the Lord and are living in the riches of the resurrection. In such saints the Lord gains His satisfaction, nourishment, and supply. How wonderful if the Lord among us can say, “Eat, O friends; drink, and drink deeply, O beloved ones!”
