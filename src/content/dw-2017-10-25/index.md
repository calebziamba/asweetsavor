_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

At Moriah, Abraham dared not disobey God, for he had been brought to the place that he had no one but God. He was in God’s hand and trusted Him completely. He wanted one thing more than anything else—God Himself.
