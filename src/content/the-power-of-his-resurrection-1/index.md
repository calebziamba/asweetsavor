If we are gaining Christ and found in Him, we have arrived at a very marvelous stage of Christian experience and are ready to face the fifth mountain: “That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death” (v. 10). This is very much a matter of subjective experience. To really know Christ, we must experientially know the power of His resurrection, the fellowship of His sufferings, and what it is to be conformed to His death.
