_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_ _– John 1:29_

We should all tell the Lord, “Lord, I’m so happy. I can enjoy You as the Lamb, as my Redeemer. All my sins have been taken away. Hallelujah! There is nothing left of my sins.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 74.
