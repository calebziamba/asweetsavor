_You shall make a window for the ark, and finish it to a cubit from the top._ _– Genesis 6:16_

God told Noah, “You shall make a window for the ark” (Gen. 6:16). A window lets in light. When we are controlled and supplied by the living word of God, our serving is under the light so that people can know our work is according to God’s desire.

Only when we have the living word are we enabled to live uniquely for Christ and the church. Through the Lord’s living word, He becomes our life, and as the church becomes our living, we become His testimony.
