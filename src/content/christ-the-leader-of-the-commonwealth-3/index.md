> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> — Philippians 3:20 Darby

This heavenly commonwealth is the upward call Paul spoke of: “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 3:14). We press on toward Christ because we are called into this commonwealth. As we pay the price to pursue Him, we experience and gain Christ as the reality of this commonwealth.
