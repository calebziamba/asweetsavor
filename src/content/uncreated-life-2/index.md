> Thou art my God—the All-Sufficient One,  
> Thou canst create for me whate’er I lack;  
> Thy mighty hand has strewn the lonely track  
> With miracles of love and tender care

In our human life, we have many needs. God, as the uncreated and creating One, creates for us whatever it may be that we need. God created my wife for my lack, and God created me for hers. We need to have the realization that this uncreated life, this Creator God, is such a God.
