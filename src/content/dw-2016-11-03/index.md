_“Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name.”_ _– Genesis 11:4_

Even a Christian work can be in the principle of rebellion if we use it to build up ourselves and gain a name. When we consider that the work is ours rather than the Lord’s, we are no longer under the authority of God. We no longer allow the Lord to be our Lord. Instead, we try to bear the responsibility ourselves. In the eyes of God, this is to exalt ourselves, to seek equality with God.
