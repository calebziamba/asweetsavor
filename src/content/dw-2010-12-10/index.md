_“My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh that lies at night between my breasts.” — Song of Songs 1:13_ If you have experienced something of the dealings and breaking work of the cross, you will consider it very precious. When you touch the cross the Lord has measured to you, your ointment of spikenard will spontaneously flow out. When the cross works on you, you will be changed. You will belong to heaven more. At that time you can grant God some satisfaction, for you are more willing to allow the cross to do its work, and your person is more for the Lord. At such a time you can testify, “My beloved is a bundle of myrrh that lies at night between my breasts.”
