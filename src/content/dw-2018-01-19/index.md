_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

To young people, it may seem reasonable to wait before following the Lord. Why should they waste their youth on Him? They have a bright future. They may think they should first finish college, start a career, and have a family before following the Lord, but the Holy Spirit will urge them not to wait. When the Spirit calls, He wants us to respond immediately.
