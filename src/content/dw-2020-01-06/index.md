_“You have striven with God  
__and with men and have prevailed”  
– Genesis 32:28  
_

Many times in our serving we cheat others to get our way. For example, a group of Christians serving together may not agree on some issue. Instead of praying and having fellowship together, the different sides may try to recruit others in their group to side with them. This is in the principle of Jacob joining his mother to cheat his father. All who love the Lord have done something like this. This is the kind of man God the Spirit works on. When God looks at us, He sees a Jacob who does things without God. We have our own ways and God allows us to use them. Meanwhile, He is working on us to transform us into Israel.
