Gifts in themselves will never build up the church. Don't ever trust your gift. Even though you are able to preach, even though you have a loud voice, even though you have a strong spirit, they will never build up the church. What builds up the church? Ministries build up the church. Are you saved? Amen. So are you gifted? Yes. Are you useful? I'm not quite sure. Why are you not quite sure? It all depends on how much you are under the Lordship.
