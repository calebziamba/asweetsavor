_Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn ewes Which have come up from their washing, All of which bear twins, And not one among them has lost her young. — Song of Songs 4:2_

Third, the Lord praises her teeth, saying, “Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes that have come up from the washing, all of which have borne twins, and none of them is bereaved of her young.”

Sheep’s wool refers to a fleshly life. The cloth of the priest is made of white linen, not wool, because wool is related to sin. Being shorn means that her flesh has been taken out of the way and dealt with.
