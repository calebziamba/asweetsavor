_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

When Sarah died, Abraham bowed down before the children of Heth and asked for land to bury her (Gen. 23). God had called him, and he served God for the rest of his life. Yet in the end, he didn’t even have land to bury his wife. He had to bow down before the people of the land and say, “I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me a burial site among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight” (23:4). This man had nothing but God.
