When the Lord first touched you, He brought you a good nature. That good nature brought in a good personality. You should grow this good personality in fear and godliness. “In fear” is to fear God; “in godliness” is to live out God. You fear God in your heart and live out God in your living. If you fear God and live Him out, it will discipline your character, preserve the good personality that God has constituted into you, and enable its continued growth.
