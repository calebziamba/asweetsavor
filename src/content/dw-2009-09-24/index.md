_It is vain for you to rise up early, To lie down late, To eat the bread of toil; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep. Behold, children are a gift of Jehovah, The fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one's youth. How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate. — Psalm 127:2-5_

Today in the church life we are so short of mighty men! We all love the Lord, we have all given ourselves to the Lord, but how many of us have truly gone to sleep? How many of us have really learned the lesson, “Lord, I rest in You. I trust you to transform me and make me fruitful. As I am buried, as I learn to put myself aside, may there be children from the fruit of my womb. Build up something in me that can make me useful to You.”

Only then can we know how to confront and deal with so many situations. Only then are we equipped with arrows to fight the enemy. After going through such a process we will be useful to the Lord.
