_For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me._

 

_For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face, that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself. — Colossians 1:29-2:2_

Paul indicates that the serving brothers must not only suffer, but also struggle for the Body life. The apostle’s struggling was according to the operation of God within him (Col. 1:29; 2:1). He suffered for the saints’ growth, but he struggled for their building up.

To grow is one thing, and to be built up is another. One’s growth comes more easily than one’s building up. This is why we need some that know how to struggle for the saints to be knit together in love (2:2).
