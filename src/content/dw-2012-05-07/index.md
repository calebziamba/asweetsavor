_"On my bed night after night I sought him Whom my soul loves; I sought him but did not find him. I must arise now and go about the city." — Song of Songs 3:1-2_

After seeking the Lord, without success, while lying on her bed, the maiden finally realizes that the solution is not to adjust her spiritual life. Therefore she says, "I must arise now and go about the city."

She has paid a real price for not following the Lord. The loss of the Lord’s presence has made her feel frustrated and helpless. On the one hand, she has no taste for the world. On the other hand, she cannot gain the Lord’s presence. She is so troubled because she can gain nothing that she desires. Unless she goes forth to seek the Lord, she can no longer rest.
