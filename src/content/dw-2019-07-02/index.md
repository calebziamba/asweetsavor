_“Rightly do they love you.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:4_

The building up of the church does not depend on workers but on lovers of the Lord. When such lovers come together, the church can be built up. In contrast, struggling with others to gain some advantage will only harm the church. For example, if we feel we must fight to be the “prince’s daughter” (7:1), we may stumble other virgins whom we consider to be in competition with us for that honor.
