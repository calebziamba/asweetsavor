_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

Romans 5–8 shows how God’s life dwells within us. By His life we exit our inheritance in Adam and enter our inheritance in Christ. This includes our exit from the bondage of the flesh (7:14) and our entrance into the freedom of the Holy Spirit (8:2). Romans 12–16 shows us that the experience of the growth of life includes being renewed and transformed, and that these lead to us living a real church life.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 17.
