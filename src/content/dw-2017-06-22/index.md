_You are My friends if you do what I command you._ _– John 15:14_

Instead of being One who desires to punish us, Christ is our real Friend. First, He is the Lamb of God who takes away all our sins. Next, He is our Friend. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we realize that we can open up everything to Him. Even the worst sin we ever commit, we can tell Him. There may even be things that we can’t tell our own family, but we can still tell Him.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 76.
