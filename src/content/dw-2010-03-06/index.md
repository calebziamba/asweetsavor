In the church life, there are more young sisters than young brothers, but eventually it is the brothers who become more manifested. The reason for this has to do with this issue of equipping. When sisters get married and have children, it is natural for them to care for their children. It is not normal for a sister to have a heart only for the Lord and yet have no heart for her children. We must take good care of our children. At the same time, however, we need to continue to give ourselves to the Lord.

I have known some sisters with children who have remained healthy before the Lord. These sisters have remained healthy because they have continued to equip themselves. They have determined not to allow their love for the Lord to weaken, or their mind to be overly taken up, or any problem to come up in their will between themselves and the Lord. Thus they have guarded their emotion, their mind, and their will.
