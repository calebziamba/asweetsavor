_"My beloved is mine, and I am his; He pastures his flock among the lilies. Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag On the mountains of Bether." — Song of Songs 2:16-17_

“Bether” means “full of valleys.” This must refer to all the experiences the Lord has gone through—His suffering, scourging, death on the cross, resurrection, ascension, and glorification. The seeker of the Lord has only the terms of these experiences, but not their reality. She is not even interested in entering into their reality. She is still saturated with the enjoyment of the banqueting house, where she continues to extol His love. She is still focused on the raisin cakes and apples the saints provide for her refreshment. She is still living on the plain rather than the mountain.

Although she knows the Lord is calling her upward, her experience is, “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak” (Matt 26:14). Therefore she has no choice but to cry out, “Oh, Lord, until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, please turn on the mountains of Bether. At that time, take away all that comes between us so that I may yet enjoy the riches and glory of resurrection. I do desire that all You intend for me would become my reality!”
