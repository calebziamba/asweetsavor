This is the third message of the message series ["Our Treasures in Christ"](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-2010-spring/) of the Spring 2010 conference given by Titus Chu.

The Lord Jesus died, paying the greatest price, so that we could be His treasure, which is composed of His many “pearls” (Matt. 13:44-46). We should respond by confessing, “Lord, You died for me to make me a part of Your treasure. In turn, now I would just hide in You, allowing You to impart Your life to me, so that I really become such a pearl to You.”
