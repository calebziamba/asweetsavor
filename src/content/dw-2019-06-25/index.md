_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

This verse indicates that our individual, hidden  
experience in the King’s chambers affects others. Instead of being alone, we are attached to others. As  
a result of our experience of the chambers, we have  
an expression and manifestation that causes the other  
virgins to be glad and rejoice in the Lord.
