_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

After we have learned the first principle of being a seed—that of dying and being hidden, even buried—we must go on and learn the next principle, which is that we must be full of life.

Any seed which is healthy must be full of life. This is true even when there is no manifestation. On the one hand we have to say, “Lord, I want to die. I want to be hidden. I want to be buried.” On the other hand, we have to say, “Lord, I want to be filled with life.”

How will this life come out? How will this life operate and manifest itself? We don’t know. But we do know that each of us must be a person who is filled with life.
