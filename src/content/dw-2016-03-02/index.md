_The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown._ _– Genesis 6:2, 4_

This mixture of the sons of God (fallen angels, Jude 6–7) with the daughters of men produced the Nephilim, or giants, the mighty men of renown. God hated this mixture. He reacted to it, saying, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh” (Gen. 6:3). In God’s creation everything was according to its own kind (1:12, 21, 25). God desires purity. If we love the world as well as God and desire the things on the earth as well as the things above, our situation does not match God’s desire (1 John 2:15–17).
