_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._ _—Philippians 2:8_

While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was “found in appearance as a man” (v. 8). He was restricted and confined, needing to eat, sleep, and labor, just as we do. He grew up as a typical boy.

I doubt that as a child He said to Joseph, “Do you know who I am? I am Almighty God. Make sure you behave around Me.” Instead, Jesus grew just as any boy would and gradually, as His understanding grew, so also did His knowledge of who He was (Luke 2:40, 48–49). As a man, He labored as a carpenter until He was about thirty (Mark 6:3; Luke 3:23).
