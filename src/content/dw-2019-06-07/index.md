_“Draw me; we will run after thee.”_

_– Song of Songs 1:4, KJV_

A real lover of the Lord is bound to others. Such a one knows that “Draw me” will result in “We will run after you.” His experience before the Lord becomes the blessing of the saints, and the experience of the saints becomes his blessing. The seeker of the Lord prays, “Please draw me. If You want us to follow You, You have to draw me, for if You draw me, we will all run after You.”
