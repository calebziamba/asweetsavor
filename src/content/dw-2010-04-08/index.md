In order to gain others, the Catholic Church has even gone to the extreme of making statues of Mary the mother of Jesus in the form of local goddesses, and remaking pagan festivals into Christian celebrations, as in the case of Christmas. In Brazil, the Catholic Church condones a fleshly festival called Carnival (which literally means “of the flesh”). During Carnival time, everyone is allowed to sin. When that festival is over, there are long lines at the confessional booths. Catholicism has adopted what they feel is logically the best way to gain or keep people.
