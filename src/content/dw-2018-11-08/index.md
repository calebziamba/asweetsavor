Even the Lord Jesus considered the fruit He bore. He passed through so much suffering, but He did not boast in that. Rather, He boasted in that which His sufferings produced. The Lord boasted of those begotten out of His crucifixion and resurrection: “Behold, I and the children whom God has given Me” (Heb. 2:13).
