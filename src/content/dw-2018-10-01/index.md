When the Jews in Jerusalem sought to kill Paul, the church “brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus” (Acts 9:30). Eventually Barnabas came again to Paul and brought him to Antioch (11:25–26), where different races and social classes were represented. The church life there brought Paul into a healthier and broader fellowship, and his leadership began to develop.
