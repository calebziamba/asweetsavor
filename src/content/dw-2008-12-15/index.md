_And you, though dead in your offenses and sins.... Ephesians 2:1_

_But God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)... Ephesians 2:4-6a_ According to the Bible, before we were born again we were “dead.” Ephesians 2:1 says that we were “dead in our offenses and sins.” Of course, we may have thought that we were very much alive. But from God's point of view we were dead, because we did not have His divine, eternal life. The life of God is the life that is “really life” (1 Tim. 6:19). Our human life is temporary, but the life of God is eternal. Our human life is fallen and sinful, but the life of God is divine and incorruptible. Our human life is weak and frail, but the life of God is indestructible. When we were born again, we received the life of God Himself. We were previously dead in all our offenses and sins, but then we were born again. We received a new life, the divine and eternal life of God. Now we are truly alive!
