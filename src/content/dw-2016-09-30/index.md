_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

In Christ’s body, there is an organic order. This order is something sweet; it is not rigid or oppressive. We should not demand that others submit in a certain way. We should, however, recognize that God cares for us according to this organic arrangement.

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, page 105.
