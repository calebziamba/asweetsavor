_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

All our disputes vaporize when we truly see God. In fact, our disputing and complaining indicate that, at that moment, we are not before the Lord and we do not see Him.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; pages 122-123.
