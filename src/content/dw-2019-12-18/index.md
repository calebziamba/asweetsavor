_“Your eyes are like doves.”  
– Song of Songs 1:15  
_

If you truly follow the Lord, if you really walk in life, the Lord will ask you, “Do you have spiritual sight?” The first characteristic to become evident in a healthy Christian is that he has eyes like doves. Spiritual insight is the foundation of our following and serving the Lord. Without spiritual insight, we cannot serve the Lord in a healthy way. The better our spiritual sight is, the more we will have a healthy pursuing, and the more we will be able to lead the saints properly. In contrast, if we are spiritually “nearsighted,” God will not be able to speak clearly to us, nor will He be able to appear to us. When Eli was old, his eyes were dim, so there was no vision of the Lord through his service (1 Sam. 3:1-2). Without spiritual insight, we will not be able to serve properly.
