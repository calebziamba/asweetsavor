_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

We are easily satisfied. If we receive a little blessing, or enjoyment, or experience, we are satisfied, and if there is a little impact or effect from our serving, we are satisfied. We are unable to contain too much blessing from the Lord.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 12.
