When I first came into the church life, I was unaware of the problems. To me, even the chairs in the meeting hall seemed to be sanctified. At that time, had I been aware of all the problems in the church life, I would have been greatly surprised. Over the years, however, I have witnessed many of the things found in Corinth among the churches, and I have come to realize that they are somewhat normal.
