_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. – Romans 5:10_

Salvation is related to the divine life. Paul knew the divine life, lived in this divine life, and allowed it to organically grow and become constituted in him. This changed Paul’s nature, constitution, thinking, and living. At the same time, this life brought him through experiences of being sanctified, renewed, transformed, and glorified.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 12.
