_Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. — Exodus 19:5-6_

In Exodus 19:6, the Lord also told Moses that Israel would become to Him a holy nation.  Earthly nations care for their testimonies. Does God need a testimony? Some think that God needs nothing, except perhaps to get people saved. God, however, also needs a testimony.
