_Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing? — Matthew 6:25_ Some sisters are particular about what cosmetics they use, saying one brand is better for Asian women than another. If you really believe that, your mind, emotion, and will are lost. Others are picky about clothing, and must wear only brand name clothes. They are consumed with fashion and shopping. Some shop all afternoon and then will not go to the meeting in the evening, for they are too tired. They wear the clothes they buy only a few times, yet they are worn out by the clothes. What a waste!
