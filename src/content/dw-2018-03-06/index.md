_The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth._ _– John 1:14_

Without Christ as reality, our life is empty, but if we have Christ as reality, we will not desire anything else. We will realize that everything else is false, and everything else is vain. The only reality in this universe is Christ Himself. We must enjoy, experience, and substantiate this Christ as the only One who is real! When Christ is genuinely experienced by us, that is reality. The more we have Christ as grace, the more we have Him as reality.
