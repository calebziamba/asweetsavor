If we are waiting to go to heaven the Lord might say to us, “The moment you were born again I brought you into a rich enjoyment. Your living should be filled with the rich enjoyment of Me! Don’t wait until the next age. Today, while you are on this earth, you should be in the rich enjoyment I prepared for you.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; pages 70-71.
