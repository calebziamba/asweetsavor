_Surely I have weaned and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child rests against his mother, My soul is like a weaned child within me. O Israel, hope in Jehovah From this time forth and forever. — Psalm 131:2-3_

When we read Psalm 131:3 we should have an abiding sense of worship. Now we are people with maturity. Our soul is like a weaned child, so that we are quiet and restful. We may not be so active, but we have a pure and simple desire to be one with the Lord. We enjoy submitting to Him. We are calm and restful in His presence and are available for His needs. Now we are able to properly care for the Lord’s testimony.

This concludes the stage of enlargement from the Psalms of Ascent. In the next and final stage we will see the full display of maturity.
