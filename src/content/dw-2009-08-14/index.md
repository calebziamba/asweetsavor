_Do not look at me, because I am black, Because the sun has scorched me. — Song of Songs 1:6_

When the Shulammite becomes aware of her blackness, she does not want to be looked upon by others. When the Lord begins to attract us, for some reason it is easy for us to seek the attention of others. When someone is zealous for the Lord, he often desires to stand out and be appreciated by others. However, those who love the Lord and follow the Lord eventually shun others' attention.
