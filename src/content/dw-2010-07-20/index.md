_And all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ. — First Corinthians 10:4_

The children of Israel were encamped at Rephidim (Exo. 17:1), a name which means places of rest (Hitchcock). They were in the wilderness, but they were at rest. It was here that the Lord provided water out of the smitten rock (v. 6). Christ is our smitten rock, having been smitten on the cross (1 Cor. 10:4). We may have rest, but without experiencing Christ as our thirst-quencher, we do not have the truest rest. We must hide in the death of Christ, who has been smitten for us, realizing that it is in His death that He supplies to us all His riches.
