_I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints. — Ephesians 1:18_ Ephesians shows us that the Triune God has an eternal purpose focused upon gaining a glorious inheritance in His people (1:9–14, 18). This inheritance is His heart’s desire. It matches Him and becomes His expression. God wants to become our inheritance and wants to make us His inheritance. He became a man to match us. Now He wants us to match Him. He is glorious; He needs a counterpart to express His glory.

Ephesians 1 tells us that God the Father chose us and predestined us to become inheriting sons (vv. 3–6), God the Son redeemed us and brought us into that inheritance (vv. 7–12), and God the Spirit became our seal to guarantee our inheritance (vv. 13–14). Furthermore, God desires to make known to us “the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself” (1:9). God has a purpose. This purpose is His good pleasure. That is why He is so happy whenever we enter into His purpose.
