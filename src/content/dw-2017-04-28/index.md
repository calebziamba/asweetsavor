 _Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land._ _– Genesis 12:10_

Abraham’s second experience of God’s discipline was a famine that caused him to go down to Egypt (Gen. 12:10). We might think that once the Lord saves us, He would never allow famine to touch us. This shows that we are short of spiritual understanding. Sometimes we lose the sensation of the Lord’s presence or don’t feel spiritually supplied when we meet with other believers. In our spiritual experience, these are famines.
