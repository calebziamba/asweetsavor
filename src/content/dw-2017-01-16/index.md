By being born again we have become the letters of Christ. This means that the Lord is writing on us all the time. The apostle Paul says this clearly in 2 Corinthians 3:3:

_\[You are\] being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts._
