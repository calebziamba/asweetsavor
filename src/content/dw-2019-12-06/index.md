_“While the king sat at his table,_  
_My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.”_  
_– Song of Solomon 1:12, ASV_

We thank the Lord that He works in us and breaks us. At this point we are no longer what we were before. We are no longer those who are merely zealous for the Lord and who just want the Lord for our own enjoyment. Now we have experienced a little breaking from His work upon us, and we also bear the marks of this work. As a result, we give forth a fragrance that the Lord truly appreciates, because it is the result of His working upon us.

We need to bear such a fragrance unto the Lord. It is not enough just to give something to the Lord and labor for Him. We also need to be dealt with by the Lord, for only as we are broken can this wonderful life flow out from within us. Only then can our spikenard give forth its fragrance, a fragrance that satisfies not only the saints, but also the King who is at His table.
