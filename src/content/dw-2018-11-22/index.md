When we teach, we should present Christ in a way that fits the need of whomever we are with. The Lord talked about high things with the educated Nicodemus (John 3:1–21), whereas He talked about simple things with the uneducated Samaritan woman (John 4:1–42). In order to be approved, we also must be able to teach according to people’s need.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 151.
