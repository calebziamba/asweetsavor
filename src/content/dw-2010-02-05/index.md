_“Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” — Matthew 6:31-33_

My wife and I learned to be careful with every dollar. We could not afford to go out to eat, or even to eat that well at home. My wife was pregnant at the time, and neither one of us had a job. A certain amount of money was needed to pay for childbirth expenses, and I did not know how that need would be met, for we were not being cared for by the church, nor by anyone else for that matter. We didn’t have anything, and all I could do was trust in the Lord.

Then one day my wife stopped by her previous employer’s office to visit her colleagues. One of them noticed that she was pregnant and asked whether she became pregnant while she was still working there. As this was the case, she was told that she was eligible for five hundred dollars towards hospital expenses. That was exactly the amount we needed. When I heard this, I had a praise to the Lord within me. I told Him, “Lord, You are living and You are real.”
