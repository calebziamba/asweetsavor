The content of this dispensation is Christ Himself and Christ as life, as our life supply. In this dispensation, we have everything within us to uphold us, to carry us, to live with us, to support us, and to bear us so that we are able to be people really after God's heart

From _[Visions & Revelations, Volume One](https://www.asweetsavor.org/visions-and-revelations/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 24
