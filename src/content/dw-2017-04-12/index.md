_Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord._ _– Genesis 12:8_

Abraham pitched his tent between Bethel and Ai and built another altar. Bethel means “the house of God” (Smith, p. 87). In the New Testament, the house of God refers to the church (1 Tim. 3:15). Abraham’s tent was between Bethel and Ai. Ai means “heap of ruins” (Smith, p. 28). Our life is between the church and the heap of ruins. In other words, it is between the church and our flesh.
