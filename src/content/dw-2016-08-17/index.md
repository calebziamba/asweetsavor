Some brothers like to argue and compete with one another, or even compete in giving a message. This shows that they are neither God-fearing nor godly. In other words, they don’t have God in their speaking. They only care about how well they speak.

If you have God, you don’t need to compete. You can gain Christ no matter how you speak. You can supply Christ no matter whether people like your speaking or not. If you are in fear and godliness, you won’t focus on the speaking itself. You will instead focus on how to live out God so that people can sense God and touch God Himself. If you keep on exercising in this way, the good personality constituted in you will be preserved.
