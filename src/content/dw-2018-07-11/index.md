_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren._ _– Romans 8:29_

In our previous state of condemnation, we needed both the judicial redemption of Christ and His organic salvation. God not only justified us through our obtaining of judicial redemption but is also presently sanctifying us in our experience of organic salvation. Christ not only died for us so that we might die together with Him, but He also lives for us so that we might live together with Him (Rom. 6:1–11).

All of God’s work in us is unto these three aspects.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 11.
