_"He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:3-4_

Brothers and sisters let me ask you, what is the church? A normal church is a banqueting house, a house of wine. It is the place where you can be satisfied and even be drunk in spirit. In this house of wine, you can enjoy the Lord in the midst of all the other saints. It is the place where, instead of bondage, there is satisfaction and rejoicing in the presence of the Lord. It is the place that brothers and sisters treasure. In the church life you should not experience toil or sighing. Instead, you should experience satisfaction and joy.
