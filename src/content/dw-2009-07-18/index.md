_But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. — John 16:13_

We need to remember that God is Spirit. If we want to worship Him, we must worship Him in spirit. The Spirit we enjoy is also the Spirit of reality, who is bringing us into all the reality. He is unveiling all the riches of Christ to us. All the riches of Christ are in our spirit. In our spirit there is no ritual, form, or religious practice. In our spirit we enjoy a living person. We enjoy Him as the Lamb. All our sins are taken care of. We enjoy Him as our Friend. We can tell Him all our problems. We enjoy Him as our older Brother. We are going to be the same as He is. We enjoy Him as the good Shepherd. He is the sovereign One who arranges every step of our lives, and we can trust Him. We enjoy Him as the Builder, who is building us into His Body and into the practical church life. And finally, we enjoy Him as the Bridegroom. We are going to marry Him.

The more we fellowship over these points, the more our spirits will be stirred up. Oh, we really have a wonderful Christ! Our Christ is so lovely, so enjoyable, and so real! He is the Lamb, He is our Friend, He is our older Brother, He is our Shepherd, He is the Builder, and He is the Bridegroom. When we enjoy Him this way, we realize we have no more problems and no more difficulties. We don't have to make an effort to do anything. We were not born again so that we would have to struggle so hard. We were born again into a living of enjoyment. We can enjoy Christ as everything to us. We must surely worship the Lord. May we all tell the Lord how much we love Him and enjoy Him! “We love You, Lord! In the whole universe we don't want to care for anyone or anything else. We only want to care for You. Lord, may You gain us completely for Yourself. Thank You for all that You are to us! Thank You that we can know You and enjoy You as such a wonderful living person!”
