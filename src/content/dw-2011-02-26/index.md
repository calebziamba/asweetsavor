_When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart. And all these signs came to pass that day. When they came to Gibeah, behold, a group of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them. And when all who knew him previously saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, "What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?" â€” First Samuel 10:9-11_ I hope many would desire what Saul experienced at this time. We should not be satisfied to remain the same. We should ask God to anoint us until we become a different person, someone filled with the Holy Spirit.

When others see us, they should feel they are seeing a new person. O how we need a new heart that comes from being filled with the Spirit! Our church life should not be in a set, predictable pattern. It should be filled with people saturated with the Spirit. God is moving, and we are moving with Him! He is buoyant and vital, and we must be the same. Lord, fill us with Your Spirit! O Lord, saturate us! Make us new!
