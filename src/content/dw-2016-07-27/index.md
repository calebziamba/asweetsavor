There are two kinds of people who will cause problems as they get older. The first is the person who can do everything and see everything. The second is the person who considers “living in a castle in the air” as being spiritual. Especially the sisters tend to have this problem. Some sisters like to tell others, “You have to touch the feeling within. What is your feeling? What does the anointing say?” This answer only confuses others; it doesn’t solve their problems. Such saints often enjoy the divine nature, but they don’t have a proper understanding of the matter of character. As a result, the divine nature has no way to produce a good personality in them, and without a good personality, we cannot serve the Lord.
