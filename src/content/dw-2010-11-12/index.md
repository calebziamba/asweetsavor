_And when He had deposed Saul, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will. — Acts 13:22_

None of the judges thought to seek what was really in God’s heart. We also may be very busy doing things in the Lord’s name, but are we charged by seeing what is in His heart? God is not after project leaders; He is after those who seek Him and serve according to His heart.
