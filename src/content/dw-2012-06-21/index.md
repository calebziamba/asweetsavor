_Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day—things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. — Colossians 2:16-17_ We are now alive in Christ. We are living unto Christ, and He is alive to us. All the other things, even though they may be positive, are but shadows; Christ is the reality (2:16-17). The Sabbath may have been good, but it was only a shadow of Christ. The feasts may have been good, but they also were but shadows of Christ. Christ is the real Sabbath, and He is the real feast. The One whom they foreshadowed has come. I enjoy Christ now as my true Sabbath; I am totally at rest when I am in Him.

Oneness should issue forth when we enter into the realization of Christ as the substance of all the shadows. We do not need anything other than Christ. When we are at rest in Christ, we are not occupied with what promotes division among us.
