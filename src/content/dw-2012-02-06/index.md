_"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_ The Lord desires to find us not only in the clefts of the rock but also in the covert of the precipice. The precipice is a place to which ordinary men cannot climb, but the Lord is there. The word “covert” indicates fellowship.

Therefore the meaning of the phrase “in the covert of the precipice” can be interpreted “in the fellowship of the precipice.” In other words, it means “in the fellowship of resurrection,” for the precipice represents the central height to which the Lord attained in His resurrection.
