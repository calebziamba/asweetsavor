_“I am the rose of Sharon,  
 The lily of the valleys.”  
– Song of Songs 2:1  
_

We are often not willing to be just a rose of Sharon. Brothers and sisters, we live in God’s mercy. We pursue God because His love attracts us. It is the Lord who brings us into His chambers. It is the Lord who reveals His cross to us. It is the Lord who works in us and who supplies us with His life. Besides these things, what can we boast in? We are nothing but a rose of Sharon.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, pages 71-72.
