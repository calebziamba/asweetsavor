_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God_  
_–_ _Romans_ _1:1_

The gospel is described here as being “of God” (v. 1). This means the gospel could be characterized by God, full of God, destined toward God, or it could belong to God (Wallace, 727–728). Verse 3 further defines this gospel as “concerning His Son.” Of this, Martin Luther wrote, “The meaning of these words, in my opinion, is this: The Content, or Object of the Gospel, or as some put it, the Subject, is Jesus Christ, the Son of God…. Gospel is not merely what Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John have written, but, as the verse shows, the Word concerning the Son of God, who was made man, suffered, and was glorified” (Luther, 35–37).
