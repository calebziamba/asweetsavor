_“You shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them, until the Lord has given your brethren rest, as He gave you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving them.” — Joshua 1:14b-15b_

If every church is only for itself, then no church can prevail. How foolish it is for churches to compete for members. It is a problem when we only care for our own church. We must fight for the one testimony to take the one inheritance. Travel to visit other churches. We shouldn’t be for our church alone. This is the principle Joshua stood upon. Yes, you found your home and your land, but don’t be for your “tribe” alone. Rise up in fellowship with all the “tribes” to take the land.
