The first factor for Paul’s approvedness was his sincerity, in that he was unwavering in doing what he believed to be of God. His vision became his burden, and he was desperate to carry it out. Anyone who sincerely loves the church will also be desperate and burdened for whatever profits it. In order to be approved, it is not sufficient for us merely to say, “I love the Lord.” Our living must exhibit an absoluteness that proves our sincerity.
