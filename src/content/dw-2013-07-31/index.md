_“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;_ _I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam._ _I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;_ _I have drunk my wine and my milk._ _Eat, friends;_ _Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:1_

In saying, “I have gathered my myrrh with my spice,” the Lord is saying, “I have searched your heart and have found the operation and the work of My death in you. Instead of sin and the world, I find the scars and wounds which mark the work of the cross. The lessons of the cross that you have garnered I now gather for My enjoyment.” The experiences of death (represented by myrrh) that we pass through belong to the Lord. Although we paid the price to gain these experiences, they are ultimately for the Lord to enjoy in us.
