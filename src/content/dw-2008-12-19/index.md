_Therefore do not be anxious, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear for clothing?" For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you._ _â€” Matthew 6:31-33_

At times the Lord brings us into situations that are hard to understand, but these are the times we should seek the Lord for His mercy. When we are no longer assured of our source of supply, we really begin to seek the Lord.

For example, it is not until college students graduate that they confront the real thing. Until then, they are sheltered by their parents' money or by financial aid. They think that after graduating, they will find a way. They will, but they should never believe that any situation is rock-solid. Even the companies that appear most stable can fold in a matter of months. There are times when the Lord will make it evident that we must trust in Him and not in anything else.
