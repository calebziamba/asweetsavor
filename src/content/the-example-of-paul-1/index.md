Paul, though so joined to Christ, still had to say, “I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him.” He determined that nothing would contaminate his heart and crowd Christ out. This is why when the Corinthians were disputing about whether or not they should eat meat offered to idols, Paul could simply respond, “Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” When we grow to this extent, issues such as this will not concern us.
