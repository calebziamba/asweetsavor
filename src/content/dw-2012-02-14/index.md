_"Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards, While our vineyards are in blossom." — Song of Songs 2:15_ The eyes of the seeker are upon the vineyards. She treasures the perfection and completion of her work. Therefore she says the vineyards are in blossom, but the foxes are making trouble. Foxes here represent the human flesh. They can represent, for example, the zealous ones, not controlled by the Spirit, who kill the meetings with their teachings of dead letter. According to the Shulammite’s understanding, as long as there are no fleshy ones making trouble, the Spirit in the church life will be released and the work will advance. Nevertheless the Lord reminds her, “Don’t focus on the work!”

The Lord did not endorse her earlier concern about her vineyard either (1:6). Here, at the end of chapter 2, she still has not learned this lesson, for she is still concerned about the blossoming vineyards. We tend to take notice of the blossoms, but not the grapes. We cannot just produce blossoms. We have to produce grapes for the life supply. Although the seeker has had considerable experience, she is still focused upon the work, thinking about how to catch the little foxes.
