_“The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’ Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me.” — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

In this section of the Song of Songs we see a seeker of the Lord who is deprived of the Lord’s presence because she does not respond to His call. Brothers and sisters, from this we realize that if we have the experience of being saved and of loving the Lord, yet being apart from the Lord, we are miserable.

If we think that a taste of the Lord’s love and comfort is sufficient and good enough for us, we are miserable. If we become self-satisfied and complacent with just a little achievement, we are miserable. If we consider that some accomplishment is sufficient for our whole serving life, we are miserable. If we do not realize the importance of spiritual growth, we are just miserable Christians.
