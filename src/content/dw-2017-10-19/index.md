_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

Those who have no experience of God are not afraid of Him. Spiritual growth results in fearing God. The more we grow, the more we fear God. The younger we are spiritually, the less we fear God.
