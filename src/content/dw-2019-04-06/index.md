_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._  
_– Philippians 1:1_

_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father._  
_– Philippians 2:22_

Paul and Timothy shared the same stand, commitment, and labor, serving together in the gospel. Because of this, Timothy’s proven character was evident to the Philippians.
