_Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works. â€” John 14:10_

Here we see God the Son praying to God the Father, while God the Son is in God the Father and God the Father is in God the Son. This confirms that we have a unique God as the God of oneness. This oneness is not generated by outward behavior. Rather, any particular behavior results from the fact that such a oneness already exists, and this oneness exists in the realm of mutual love.
