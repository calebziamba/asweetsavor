_“Your neck is like the tower of David,_ _Built with rows of stones_ _On which are hung a thousand shields,_ _All the round shields of the mighty men.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:4_

_“Until the cool of the day_ _When the shadows flee away,_ _I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh_ _And to the hill of frankincense.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:6_

In Song of Songs 4 the Lord praises His seeker’s sight, her submissiveness, her receiving ability, her ability to generate life, her ability to speak for Him, her exercise to carry out His will, and her sensitivity to life (4:1-5). The Lord can tell her, “You have satisfied My heart.”

In spite of all this, however, she still has not fully reached the place the Lord called her to in 2:14, namely, the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice.
