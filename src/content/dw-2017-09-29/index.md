_Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb._ _– Romans 4:19_

If we still have many plans, ways, and considerations, and if we still spend so much time asking for God’s blessing on our Christian work, we have not reached the point yet where we know ourselves and our real situation. We must come to the place where we can say, “I have nothing. It is Your mercy I am here. It seems that there is no way for Your promise to be fulfilled. But because of Your mercy I cannot leave You.” Then the Lord may have a way with us.
