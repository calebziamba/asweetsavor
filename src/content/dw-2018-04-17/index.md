_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

Paul knew that his labor had produced a healthy church, for the believers in Philippi sacrificed to the Lord by serving in the gospel and caring for Paul, a servant of the Lord. Now Paul was ready to be poured out further as a drink offering upon their sacrifice.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 135.
