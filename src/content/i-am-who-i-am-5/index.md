> He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, And stretched out the heaven by His understanding.
> 
> \- Jeremiah 51:15, NKJV

Brothers, He is vital, He is full of creativity, and He is full of executing in the power of His wisdom. He is wise, but His wisdom is not a thought. His wisdom is a power. He exercises it. He executes it. Eventually, all things will happen.
