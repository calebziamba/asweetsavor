_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose._ _—Philippians 2:2_

Every Christian has the freedom to follow the Lord’s leading. Suppose some feel everyone should listen to the ministry of a certain preacher. Is this right or wrong? It may be right for some, but it is normal for the Lord to lead others differently. It is good to encourage others with what has helped us, but once we begin to insist on something, we are no longer being of the same mind or united in spirit.
