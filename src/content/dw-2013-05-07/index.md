_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ._ _â€“ Philippians 3:8_

In this verse Paul shows us what it means to be both pure and focused. Are we this way? Have we counted all things to be loss for Christ? Is gaining Christ our goal? If we can say yes, then we should be very happy. If in our Christian life we can be both pure and focused, then we will have the third characteristic of Philippians, which is being joyful.
