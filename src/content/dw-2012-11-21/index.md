_Then it came about afterwards that David inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" And the Lord said to him, "Go up." So David said, "Where shall I go up?" And He said, "To Hebron."_ _— Second Samuel 2:1_

Saul and three of his sons, including Jonathan, died during a battle with the Philistines (1 Sam. 31:1–6).

David did not immediately assume the kingship but rather was very much before the Lord. He didn’t ask the Lord to clear the way for him to become king over Israel. He only asked Him whether he should go up to any of the cities of Judah. The Lord told him, “Go up” (2 Sam. 2:1). Then David asked to which city, and the Lord told him Hebron.
