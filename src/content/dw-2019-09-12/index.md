_"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” - Genesis 28:15_

Our experience is like Jacob’s. The Lord’s blessing on us and His leading of us are beyond anything we could have expected. Though we are unworthy, fallen, selfish, stubborn, crooked sinners, yet we can live before Him, and He still works on us. We can only praise Him. How amazing it is that we can experience His calling and His boundless grace.

The breaking and constituting work of God the Spirit is based on this calling and boundless grace. Otherwise, we would be finished. Without God’s calling and grace, no one can love God or follow Him purely. We can only love God, follow Him, and be like Him because of the continuous work of the Spirit.
