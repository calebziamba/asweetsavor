_If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear, and I return to my father’s house in safety, then the Lord will be my God - Genesis 28:20-21_

Aren’t we like Jacob? None of us starts out spiritual. Like Jacob, who held his brother’s heel at birth, bought the birthright with stew, and tricked his father for the blessing, perhaps we are still struggling to be first. Like Jacob at Bethel, perhaps we selfishly seek things from God rather than God Himself. If so, we haven’t seen God yet. We may only be shouting spiritual slogans without having touched the Lord.
