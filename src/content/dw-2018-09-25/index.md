We like to be free and left alone. We feel entitled to our own way and opinion. Whether it is politics, the national economy, or the best way to grow grass, everyone has an opinion. In our culture, we are even encouraged to express our opinions. However, spiritually speaking, we experience the greatest blessing when we fellowship.
