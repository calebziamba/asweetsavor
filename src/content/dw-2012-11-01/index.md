_“He must increase, but I must decrease.”_ _— John 3:30_

These seem like such spiritual words. After reading this verse, we would even be moved to pray, “Lord, you must increase, and I must decrease.” But the Lord would respond, “What are you talking about? What do you mean by ‘decrease’? You don’t need to decrease. You need to be terminated!”

It is religion which tells us that we need to decrease. That is why there was eventually a conflict between the Lord and John the Baptist. John’s thought about himself was religious: “I must decrease.” The Lord’s thought about John was, “You must be terminated.” And the Lord’s thought about Himself was, “I am a seed. I must die. I must bring forth fruit in resurrection.”
