_“My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh  
Which lies all night between my breasts.”  
– Song of Songs 1:13  
_

At first, our experience of the Lord is primarily one of love. We were drawn by the Lord’s love and His loveliness. We saw that the Lord was worthy of our pursuit. Gradually, however, we discovered that the death of the Lord is the realization of His love in us. Apart from realizing the death of the Lord, we cannot know the meaning of His love. How can we experience His love? It is by our dying together with Him. The more we die, the more we experience His love and the more deeply we experience the riches of His love. When we are put into His death, we are put into His love. If we are constantly living in the death of the Lord, we are constantly living in His love.
