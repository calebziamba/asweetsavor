_Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?_ _– 2 Corinthians 11:28-29_

As we shepherd others, our deep sensation should be that we are impotent. This is why Paul said, “Who is weak without my being weak?” (2 Cor. 11:29). This does not mean that we join others in their weakness, but we should have the sensation of weakness.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 149-150.
