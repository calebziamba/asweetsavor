Genesis 1:4-5 says, "And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day." In this message excerpt from the 2017 Winter Conference, held in Cleveland, Ohio, brother Titus ministers concerning the experience of morning, evening, and holding a commitment through both experiences.
