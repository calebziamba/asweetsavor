No movement, no matter how great, can substitute for the living flow with its grace and reality in fulfilling God's purpose.

During the late 1960s and early '70s, thousands of young people came to the Lord during the so-called Jesus movement. On certain campuses at that time, many believers could be found. We are thankful that so many came to Christ through that movement, yet at that time there was no solid teaching of the word and very little experience of life and light among them. There was virtually no experience of the Lord's tabernacling, and the enjoyment of grace and reality was insufficient. Therefore such a widespread movement could not produce what God was after. If we want to fulfill God's desire today, we must know the reality of the divine flow.
