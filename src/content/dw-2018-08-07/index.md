_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

God’s life is able to lead us in every environment to richer spiritual experiences, to further operations of His life, and to the overcoming of any hardships and obstacles. These experiences are good indicators of whether we are currently living in organic salvation or not.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 15.
