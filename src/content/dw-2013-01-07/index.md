_“How beautiful you are, my darling,_ _How beautiful you are!_ _Your eyes are like doves behind your veil;_ _Your hair is like a flock of goats_ _That have descended from Mount Gilead.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:1_

According to the Lord’s praise of the seeker at this point in the Song of Songs, she now bears seven kinds of fruit unto Him. First, her eyes have become like doves behind her veil. Second, her hair is now like a flock of goats that repose on Mount Gilead. Third, her teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes. Fourth, her lips are like a scarlet thread. Fifth, her cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate behind her veil. Sixth, her neck is like the tower of David. And seventh, her two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies (4:1-5). The lover of the Lord in the Song of Songs bears such a testimony.
