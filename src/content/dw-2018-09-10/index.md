_When many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him, but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death; but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a large basket._ _– Acts 9:23-25_

Paul’s sincerity manifested itself immediately after his salvation. He was so burdened to preach about Jesus that the Jews sought to kill him. The disciples had to lower him in a basket so he could escape (Acts 9:24–25). He then went to Jerusalem and disputed with the Hellenists until they also wanted to kill him (9:29). Wherever Paul went, there was a strong reaction.
