_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

Through encouragement, consolation, and fellowship, we bring God to others in a human way. When Moses came down from the mountain after being with the Lord for forty days and forty nights, the skin of his face was shining. Rather than subduing everyone with his countenance, he covered his face with a veil for the sake of the people (Exo. 34: 28–35).

Often we go to people’s homes looking like Moses with his face uncovered: “Here I come. I have just been praying three hours for you!” However, those whom we visit may not be ready for a visit from God at that moment; they may instead need a visit from one who is a man like them.
