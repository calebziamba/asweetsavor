> \[The Lord Jesus Christ\] will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.
> 
> – Philippians 3:21

Today, the Lord is using everything—even the unreasonable things—so that we might grow to the greatest degree of glory... We can restfully take all things from His hand, knowing that what is taking place is for our conformation today and our glorification in that day.
