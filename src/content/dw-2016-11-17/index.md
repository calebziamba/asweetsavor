_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

Once we have been captured by God’s appearing, we need not fear that we will leave Him to walk our own way. If we have the Lord’s appearing, we cannot be chased away but will be willing to suffer for the Lord even with tears. Sometimes we may feel reluctant, but something within holds us. Once the Lord appears to us, we immediately enter another realm.
