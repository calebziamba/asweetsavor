_"My beloved is mine, and I am his; He pastures his flock among the lilies. Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag On the mountains of Bether." — Song of Songs 2:16-17_ There is one thing about the seeking one that cannot be faulted at this point: she still has a sweet relationship with the Lord. She says, “My beloved is mine, and I am his” (2:16). Why can she say this? It is because of her past experience. She is still in the banqueting house, and the banner over her is still love. She has the raisin cakes and apples from the saints to sustain her. The Christ in the saints and the Lord Himself is her enjoyment. She is positioned in a place full of enjoyment. Therefore she says, “My beloved is mine, and I am his.”

Someone trapped in works cannot know his real situation. His work becomes the wall separating him from the Lord. Why does such a person still seem to sense the Lord’s sweetness? It is because his focus on the work forces him to go to the Lord. It is not that the Lord is truly his beloved, and that he is the Lord’s. While he is serving, he has to go and ask the Lord about the meetings, the labor, the care for the saints, and so on. Seemingly it brings him into a situation where he feels that the Lord is his and he is the Lord’s, but this sensation will eventually collapse, for it is like the house built upon the sand.
