_"Many times they have afflicted me from my youth," Let Israel now say; "Many times have they afflicted me since my youth, yet they did not prevail against me." — Psalm 129:1-2_

The younger ones among us should ask themselves, “Will I still be here in ten years?” This is not a light matter. Young brothers and sisters, there is no guarantee that in a few years all of you will still be here. That is why it is so improper for you to look at the older saints and think, “You are out of date.” Without the older ones you wouldn’t even be here.

You need to learn to appreciate them and be thankful for them. They have paid a tremendous price to remain in the church life. The older ones can testify of much affliction from their youth. Ever since they first began to follow the Lord in the church life, He has measured to them all kinds of difficult environments. Yet the older ones can boldly testify, “They have not prevailed against me!"
