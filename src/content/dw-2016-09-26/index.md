_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

_“He will not cry out or raise His voice,_ _Nor make His voice heard in the street._ _— Isaiah 42:2_

We should be impressed by this. Jesus did not raise His voice in the streets to proclaim who He was (Isa. 42:2). He was the very God, yet He did not count this as a thing to be held fast. Most of us do not have this mind. When we experience God even a little, we broadcast it to the world. In our fallen condition, we grasp at things all day long. The temptation to do this will be with us our entire lives.
