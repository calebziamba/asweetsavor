_"I will not leave you nor forsake you. Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them." — Joshua 1:5-6_

This land represents our inheritance. Once we see this inheritance, we will say, “I am so happy that God will not leave me nor forsake me. I can be strong and of good courage!”

Adapted from _[Joshua: A Life of Service,](/book-joshua "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 42.
