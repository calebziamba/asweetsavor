> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, all who are mature, let’s have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that to you as well; however, let’s keep living \[Gr. __stoicheō__\] by that same _standard_ to which we have attained.

> \-- Philippians 3:14-16 NASB

If we read something, let us read it unto the Lord. If we attend a Christian conference, let us do so unto the Lord. Everyone has a right to follow the Lord. The secret of marching together (_stoicheō_) is to not insist on things other than Christ. Just stay focused on Christ. To do otherwise is to violate the principle of this common walk, which has the goal of gaining Christ to the fullest extent.
