Individually, each of our bodies is a temple (1 Cor 6:19). Together, according to 1 Corinthians 3:16, we are the temple of God, for in this verse Paul asks,

_Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?_

It is important to note that the “you” in this verse is plural in the original Greek. Therefore, this verse is saying that all the saints are, together, a temple of God. We can also see this in 2 Corinthians 6:16, which says,

We are the temple of the living God; just as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.”
