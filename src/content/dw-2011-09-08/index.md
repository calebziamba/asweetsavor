_And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul’s hand. And Saul cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice. — First Samuel 18:10-11_

_That the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ. — First Peter 1:7_

Instead of complaining about the elders, feeling they are incompetent for not putting our talent to use, we should realize that the Lord is not making a mistake. Every spiritual thing we think we possess has to be tested to see if it is real. Therefore, not only must we be chosen, anointed, and trained, but we must also be tested. Many who love the Lord simply cannot make it through the period of testing that leads to approvedness.
