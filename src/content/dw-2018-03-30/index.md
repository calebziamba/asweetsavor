_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. —Philippians 2:16_

_I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus._ _—Philippians 3:14_

If two words mark Paul’s life, they are “run” and “toil.” Paul lived like an athlete pressing “toward the goal for the prize” (Phil. 3:14).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 133.
