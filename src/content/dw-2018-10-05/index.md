_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _– 1 Corinthians 3:6_

Although the Corinthians tried to divide Paul from Apollos, saying, “I am of Paul” and “I am of Apollos” (1 Cor. 3:4), Paul wrote, “I planted, Apollos watered” (1 Cor. 3:6), for he knew what fellowship is. Because he valued others, he was able to speak about Apollos in such a positive way.
