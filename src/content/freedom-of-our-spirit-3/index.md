> Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 3:17

There is no one that can limit anyone. Why? Because we are in a spiritual realm. We're not dealing with anything material. We're not dealing with anything in organization. We are fully dealing with a spiritual realm. In this spiritual realm, there's only perfecting; there's no way to control.
