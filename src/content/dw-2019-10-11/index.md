_Therefore I have sent \[Epaphroditus\] all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you. Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard; because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me. - Philippians 2:28-30_

Although we need to know the truth, the reality of the church life is in these human interactions. It is precious when others become sealed in our hearts and their growth and wellbeing fully occupy us. This was the case between Epaphroditus and Paul. We should not simply say to someone who is in suffering, “Trust in the Lord. He will take care of you.” We cannot practice the church life like this. Our hearts should be occupied with others’ well-being.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 170.
