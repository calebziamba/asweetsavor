_Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine. — The Song of Songs 1:2_ Wine represents something that used to satisfy us and give us enjoyment. We all had some kind of wine that we thought was the best thing in our lives. However, now we feel, “Lord, Your love is better than any wine I have ever had. When I have Your love, everything I experienced before fades away."

How do we live this life of the Song of Songs? We have to ask ourselves, “Do I still have any wine that is better than His love?” If we have a normal pursuing life, we will have a deep feeling that there is nothing better than the rich love of the Lord. No matter how attractive or glorious something in the world may seem, the Lord's love is so much better. Whenever we touch the Lord, we can testify, “Lord, Your love is better than any other wine on this earth.”
