_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._ _—Philippians 2:8_

Jesus would not be found in appearance as being different from other men. Many people, however, don’t have this attitude. They want to stand out and be noticed by others. Rather than conforming to the current fashion, they put their own stamp on things.

Paul only desired to be found in Christ (Phil. 3:9), who was in appearance as a man. If we also desire to be found in Christ, we will have this mind. We will not struggle to stand out from those around us. Instead, we will be found in appearance as those for whom we are burdened (1 Cor. 9:19–23).
