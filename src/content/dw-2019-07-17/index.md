_“My mother’s sons were angry with me;_ _They made me caretaker of the vineyards,_ _But I have not taken care of my own vineyard.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:6_

As one who loves the Lord and receives a burden to carry out something before Him, the seeker has a vineyard of her own. If you have an intimate relationship with the Lord, you will also have your own “vineyard”—something that you feel God has committed to you.

This verse indicates, however, that when you rise up to take care of your own vineyard, you will come into contact with your “mother’s sons,” that is, the leading brothers who stand for the Lord as the responsible ones in the church life. They take the responsibility in the church, so they are involved with whatever you feel you are committed with. However, if their focus is on the work, rather than on Christ Himself, it will be easy for them to be angry with the Lord’s lovers.
