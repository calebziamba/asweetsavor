_"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away. For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. The flowers have already appeared in the land; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land. The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away!'" — Song of Songs 2:10-13_

There are two words of encouragement here. First, the Lord tells us that the fig tree has ripened its figs. Second, He says that the vines are in blossom (2:13). You are like the fig tree that has ripened its figs. Some further manifestation has taken place in you. It doesn’t mean you have become fully mature in life, but it does indicate that you have achieved ripeness in the experience of this stage. Now you should go on to another experience with the Lord: it is time for you to have fruit now, for your vines are in blossom.
