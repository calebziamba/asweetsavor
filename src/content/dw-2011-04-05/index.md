_We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places_ _— Ephesians 6:12_

When we stand with God's desire for His inheritance, we are not fighting against flesh and blood. That would actually be much easier. We are fighting against principalities, powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this age.
