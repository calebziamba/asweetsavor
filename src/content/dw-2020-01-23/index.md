_"Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.  
When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket  
of his thigh; so the socket of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated while he  
wrestled with him...and he was limping on his thigh"  
\-Genesis 32:24-25, 31  
_

We shouldn’t be satisfied with our current situation. We should expect Him to touch us so that we limp and dare not use our own strength, ways, and abilities. After God wrestles with us and we see Him face to face, we will have our turning point, our experience of Peniel. From then on, we cannot but trust Him.
