Before we were born again we were under God’s judgment. Romans 3:19 says,

_Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God._

The reason God gave the Law in the Old Testament was to bring the whole world under His judgment. It was only possible for man to know his true condition because God gave him the Law. By giving the Law, God was saying to mankind, “It matters to Me what you do! I did not create human beings to be so sinful and so fallen as you are!”
