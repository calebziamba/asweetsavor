_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.” –  Acts 7:2_

The Lord said to Peter and Andrew, “Follow me.” This was His call. Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. The Lord also told them, “I will make you fishers of men.” Peter and Andrew received this promise. Although Peter later failed and denied the Lord when Jesus was arrested, judged, and crucified (Matt. 26:69–75), the Lord who had called him did not change but remained as the holding power of his faith (Luke 22:31–32).
