We may say that our nature is something inborn and that our disposition is something that we gradually cultivate. We have an inborn nature and a constituted disposition. Our disposition plus our character becomes our personality.

The nature with which we are born affects what kind of disposition we can develop. Then the disposition we have acquired is lived out through our character. This living out becomes our personality.
