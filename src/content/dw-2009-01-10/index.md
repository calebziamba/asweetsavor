_To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. — Colossians 1:27_ _I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. — Galatians 2:20_ The Bible makes it clear that after we are saved Christ lives within us.

Colossians 1:27 says, “To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” According to this verse Christ is not just on the throne in the heavens. He is within us as the hope of glory.

Second Corinthians 13:5 says, “Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?” This verse is very serious. If Christ is not in us, then we are disapproved.

Romans 8:10 says, “But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.”

Finally, Galatians 2:20 says, “I am crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.”

All of these verses prove to us that it is not the Spirit alone who came into us when we were born again. To say that the Spirit is in us merely as the representative of Christ, who is sitting on the throne in the heavens, is not correct. Now that we are born again, according to the Bible, Christ Himself lives in us.

Why is it so important to realize that Christ Himself now lives in us? It is because He wants to be subjective to us. It is not enough just to know about Him objectively. Christ wants to be real to us in our experience, and that is why He saved us.
