_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

Paul labored to cut the way for others as he preached the gospel and raised up churches. The problem today is that many have not produced anything. Rather, they have inherited what others produced.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 134.
