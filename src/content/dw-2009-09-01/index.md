_And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality. — John 1:14

Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse; you have kept the good wine until now. — John 2:10_

John 1:14 says that Christ is “full of grace and reality.” When we enjoy Christ as grace, then we also have Him as reality. Without Christ as reality our life is empty. But when we have Christ as reality, then we don't want anything else. We realize that everything else is false, and everything else is vain. The only reality in this universe is Christ Himself. We must enjoy, experience, and substantiate this Christ. When Christ is genuinely experienced by us, that is reality. The more we have Christ as grace, the more we have Him as reality.

After experiencing Christ as grace and reality, we have Him as our satisfaction. In John 2:1-11 there is a well-known description of the Lord changing water into wine at a wedding feast. The wine there signifies Christ as satisfaction. After the Lord changed water into wine, the master of the wedding feast told the bridegroom, “Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse; you have kept the good wine until now” (John 2:10). The Lord, who is the “good wine,” is better than all the wine, or satisfaction, that the world can offer. Christ Himself is the highest satisfaction. Nothing else in the world compares to Him.
