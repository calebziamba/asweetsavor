> Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.
> 
> â€“ Philippians 3:12 ASV

Through our pursuing we lay hold of that for which we also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus. This is incorporation. Christ is in us, and we are in Christ. His heart becomes our heart, and His desire becomes our desire. As the Lord moves, we move, because we are coordinated, incorporated into one. This is the highest plane of Christian existence.
