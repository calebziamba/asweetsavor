_“Let the young men now arise and compete.”_...

_So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side. — 2 Samuel 2:14, 15-16_

This kind of competition still occurs among Christians today. People tend to take sides and form parties. We all have to declare, “We are children of God! We only belong to Christ!” We should have nothing to do with competing parties.

I hope none would say that they follow me, for I am not worthy of being followed. I hope everyone would follow Christ! No matter how good the person, the teaching, or the method is, we have to say, “I am for Christ!” Otherwise, we will witness times of needless tragedy.
