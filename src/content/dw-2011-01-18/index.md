_Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus, that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. â€” Romans 15:5-6_

Christ is the source of the one accord, Christ is the content of the one accord, and Christ should be the result of the one accord. If we take away Christ, there is no one accord. If we take Christ away, that one accord will become a division.

We may see that the Lord is doing something marvelous in another place, but for some reason what happens elsewhere could become a source of division, not a source of one accord. Why? Because we begin to focus on what we should do and what we should not do, how we should do something or how not to do something. We do not focus on Christ but on the thing to do. We should do things because of Christ, and we should love others because of Christ. The one accord comes from Christ. The content, the substance, is Christ. Eventually the result is Christ. Paul said that we should, with one accord and with one mouth, glorify God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
