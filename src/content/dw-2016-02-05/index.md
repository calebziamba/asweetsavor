_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

When Moses came down from the mountain after being with the Lord for forty days and forty nights, the skin of his face was shining. Rather than subduing everyone with his countenance, he covered his face with a veil for the sake of the people (Exo. 34: 28–35). This shows us that he came into the people’s presence in a lowly manner. All of his glorious experience was hidden. Instead of displaying his profound enjoyment of God, he came as a common one among them. He seemed to cover up all that had been transmitted to him.

I have seen many Christian workers who refuse to cover themselves in this way. Instead, they declare their revelations and visions in the name of wanting to be used by God.
