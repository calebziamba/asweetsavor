_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

Once believers begin to love the Lord and to grow spiritually, they begin to receive different kinds of equipping and teaching, such as how to study the Bible, how to serve the church, and how to speak for the Lord. At this time in the process of spiritual growth, many people begin to lose the initial love they had for the Lord and desire things other than Christ.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 7.
