Something is seriously wrong if after a year we have neither borne fruit nor helped others to grow and develop in the Lord. I would refuse to live a life like that! Regardless of whether I am tired, beat up, or having difficulties, I must be effective in my labor.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 148-149.
