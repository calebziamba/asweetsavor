> Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 12:1

The pursuit and growth of the Christian life is a matter of visions. How much vision you have decides how healthy you are before the Lord. The advancement of your visions is your growth in Christ.
