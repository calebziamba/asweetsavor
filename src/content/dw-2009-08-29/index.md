_You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life. — John 5:39-40

It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. — John 6:63

_The Lord's word in John 6:63 means that the Bible itself should be the word of life for us to enjoy. It is not just a book called “the Bible”; that is too objective. When we say that the Bible is the word of life for us, that means it is very subjective. It is a shame that so many Christians take the Bible as an ethical book and not as a book of life. They don't know the riches of Christ that are in the word. The Bible is not a book of ethical teachings; the Bible is a book of life. Every word in the Bible is a word of life. If we only search the Bible for ethical teachings, we are in the wrong place. The Bible is for us to enjoy Christ Himself as the word of life. This enjoyment energizes us to follow Him.

However it is that we enjoy the Lord—praying, praising, singing a song, reading the word, or any other way—what we receive is life. The life we enjoy has several aspects: the bread of life to make us alive and strengthen us, the water of life to quench our thirst and refresh us, the light of life to shine for our daily walk, and the word of life to energize us. This is wonderful. Praise Him that we can enjoy Him as life with all of these riches for our daily needs!
