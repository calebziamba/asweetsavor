We should learn to enjoy Christ as our older Brother. In John 20:17 the Lord told Mary, on the day He was resurrected,

_Go to My brethren and say to them, “I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.”_

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; pages 77-78.
