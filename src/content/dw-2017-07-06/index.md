_I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep._ _– John 10:11_

Our enjoyment of Christ as our Shepherd should bring us peace. We don’t need to be so anxious or concerned about the different things in our lives, and we don’t need to worry so much about our future, our marriage, our job, or our education. The Lord is on the throne, and there is no need to worry. He is our good Shepherd. If we know such a wonderful Christ, we will truly worship Him. We can pray,

_Lord, I worship You for being such a great and wonderful Shepherd! My life is in Your hands, and I can entrust myself to You._
