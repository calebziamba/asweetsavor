The enjoyment of Christ as life is very good and very necessary, but it is also somewhat general. In addition to enjoying Christ as our life, we should also enjoy Him as all the items we need day by day for our spiritual living.

We can begin by eating Him as our bread of life, to be the strength for our daily living. In John 6:35 and 57, Jesus says,

_I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst....As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also will live because of Me._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 88.
