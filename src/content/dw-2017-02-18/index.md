_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

The Lord is jealous. This salvation reminds us that, besides Christ Himself, there is not one thing we can rely upon or boast in. For our entire Christian life, we will be doing this one thing: working out our own salvation. Yet everything is in the principle of salvation. It is totally of the Lord.
