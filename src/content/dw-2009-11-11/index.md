_But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God, which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words. — First Corinthians 2:12-13_

_Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. — Matthew 5:11-12_

Your spiritual awareness determines the effectiveness of your service. When you are criticized, do you react by asking the Lord whether that criticism is true? And if it is not, do you swallow it, and if it is, do you confess? Jesus said, “Blessed are you when they say every evil thing against you because of Me.” You should be prepared for this, for it is something God has arranged for all who seek to follow Him.
