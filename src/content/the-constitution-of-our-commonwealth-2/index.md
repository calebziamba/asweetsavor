> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> â€” Philippians 3:20 Darby

In the church life, we are not interested in anything other than Christ Himself. We may do things together, but the purpose of these activities must be to experience our common Christ.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 245
