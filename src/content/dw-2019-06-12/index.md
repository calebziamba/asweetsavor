_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

The person we love is our king. When we love the Lord absolutely, the Lord is our absolute King. 

The Lord’s ability to rule in our life depends on how much love we have for Him. If we give ourselves to Him without any reservation, He will be our King in every way.
