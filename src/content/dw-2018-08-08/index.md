_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Organic salvation is hard to apply and see, but we can know if we are experiencing it by how much God’s life is ruling within us daily. Has God’s life restrained our diet? Has God’s life affected our response when a car cuts us off in traffic? Has God’s life affected our attitude when someone offends us? These may all seem like trivial things, but salvation by the life of God touches all of them.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 15.
