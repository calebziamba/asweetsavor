_Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches. Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?_ _– 2 Corinthians 11:28-29_

A seventh factor for Paul’s approvedness was his fruitfulness and effectiveness. Paul testified that a deep concern for all the churches pressed upon him daily. He lived to shepherd the churches and to labor according to the vision the Lord committed to him.
