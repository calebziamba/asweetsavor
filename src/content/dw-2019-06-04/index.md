_“Let him kiss me with  
the kisses of his mouth:  
For thy love is better than wine.  
Because of the savour of  
thy good ointments  
Thy name is as ointment poured forth,  
“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2-3, KJV_

Those who love the Lord can never forsake the five characteristics found in verses 2 and 3 of the Song of Songs.

First, the Lord’s seekers are always under the Lord’s attraction. Second, they always seek to know the love of the Lord. Third, they seek the Lord Himself as the processed One, as the anointing oil with a pleasant fragrance. Fourth, such ones always appreciate the Lord’s work, as seen in the Lord’s name being an ointment poured forth. Fifth, they also love the church and appreciate the saints. As a result, the church is manifested.
