_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _— Philippians 1:2_

When you spent time with the Lord this morning, did you experience grace or did you get distracted with all the concerns of the day? Did you touch the living person of Christ by singing a hymn, by opening your heart in prayer, or by enjoying the Bible? Did you experience something so profound that it reached your spirit and touched your heart? If so, you have experienced grace. You forget who and where you are. You feel so satisfied and realize the value of your Christian life. Grace means that Christ comes to you for your enjoyment. This doesn’t merely give you a sense of happiness but a deep and profound satisfaction.

We must be brought into the rich enjoyment of a person, Christ Jesus. This brings us a deep satisfaction. The Christian life is so marvelous, because it is the enjoyment of a living person, Christ Himself, as grace.
