_“Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.”_

_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.”

_

_— Song of Songs 2:17-3:1_

Here in chapter 3, the maiden has grown in life to the point that the Lord is able to deal with her further. Because of her disobedience, the spiritual discipline comes to her—the Lord’s presence is taken away. Since the Lord’s presence as the One outside the wall is gone, so is His presence as the One inside the banqueting house.

Actually, the action of the Lord within and without the wall is the same. The grace that the Lord supplies us within the wall is for us to be able to answer His call to rise up and come away to the next stage in our pursuing. However, if we cannot obey, the grace within the wall will be taken away.
