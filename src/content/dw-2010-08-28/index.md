_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

God doesn’t work while you are sleeping; after waking up you don’t find a gold crown woven into your hair. You will surely feel it when the Lord works on you.The work of the cross is what produces your crown, and the more you possess this crown, the more you will be able to truly help others and genuinely serve.

Making your own hair beautiful could not stand up to any kind of challenge in the environment. The younger ones whom you serve will also make their own plaits. When Satan comes to attack, their plaits will just fall down. Unless you have something divine in your constitution, woven as a crown through the work of the cross, you will not be able to help such ones.
