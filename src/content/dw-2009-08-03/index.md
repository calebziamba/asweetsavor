All the riches of the Lord's servants are riches of revelation. We have to pursue these riches and give ourselves to spend time in them. However, if we do not receive them by way of revelation, our pursuing will not be adequate. These riches must be received by means ofÃ‚Â  revelation.

Thus we have to receive the word of the ministry by means of our spirit, for the word of the ministry is based upon revelation, and revelation is related to our spirit. First the Holy Spirit will make our spirit alive and then He will grant us revelation. When we have received something by way of revelation, our life and existence will be changed by what we have seen. What we possess as a result of revelation is vision. This vision is the view that becomes the controlling factor in our life. This is the process by which the Holy Spirit constitutes us with the truth.
