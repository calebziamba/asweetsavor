I was asked to migrate to North Carolina to help pioneer a testimony for the Lord. After fellowship and prayer, it was decided that I should find a job there. The goal was that I could use it as a field to labor for the Lord. So, I began my job hunt.

It was a long and mentally grueling process. I knew this was the direction the Lord had asked me to go, but I often felt very discouraged along the way — especially as time went by and it seemed like nothing was working out. However, I knew that the saints were praying for me, that the Lord would provide a job according to what He had put on my heart. After almost 2 months from when I moved, I was finally able to sign an offer letter for a position. Due to some complications, it was another month after that before I could even begin working.

After I started working, I was so thankful to the Lord. I felt in my heart that this job was sovereignly arranged by Him, and answered the prayers of the saints. I am so sure of this. In the first few weeks, I had people on my heart to pray for and begin to get to know. I was able to share with my orientation class and also on a work Zoom call that my faith in Jesus is what drives me.

I know that this all was made possible through the prayers of the saints. I did not move to North Carolina for this job. I moved here for the Lord’s testimony. I am excited to see how the Lord can use me in this place to reach my co-workers, be a light for Him, and to help raise up His testimony here.
