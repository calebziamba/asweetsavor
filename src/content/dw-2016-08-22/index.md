We shouldnâ€™t touch the things that will destroy our fear of God, our godly living, or the testimony of the church. We say that we are the local church, that we have the local ground, and that many saints with us love the Lord. However, the real testimony of the church is manifested in our godly fear and godliness. It is also manifested through those who together fear God and magnify God.
