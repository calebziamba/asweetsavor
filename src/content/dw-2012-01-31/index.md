_"O my dove, In the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_

The Lord is telling His dove that she needs two things: the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice. The clefts of the rock symbolize our union with the Lord in His death on the cross. Our going to the covert of the precipice indicates that we are able to resurrect and ascend with Him to go to a place which cannot be reached by ordinary men. When we attain to the covert of the precipice, we enjoy all of Christ’s riches in resurrection and ascension.
