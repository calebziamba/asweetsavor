If you do not possess an adequate degree of divine constitution, you will not be able to bring others into God's divine economy. If you are constituted with the divine life, however, you will be able to bring others to experience this divine economy.

If there is no constitution of divine life within you, don't bother speaking to others about God's economy. When you experience some constitution of divine life, you experience the Lord's renewing, transformation, and conformation. Through this process you experience the reality of what it means to live for God's economy. Your speaking must be backed up by the constitution of the divine life.
