_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose._ _â€”Philippians 2:2_

We should insist on nothing but Christ. If we are all focused on Him, even though we may not all be doing the same things outwardly, we are of the same mind, for we are all following the Lord. Why do some have one practice and others have a different practice? It is because of Christ and how He leads each one. We should all be focused on Christ. If our mind is occupied with Christ and His believers, we are healthy.
