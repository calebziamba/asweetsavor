As Christians we often talk about prayer, but do we know what it is? It is different from petition or intercession, as the apostle Paul states:

> Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
> 
> \- Phil. 4:6

Titus Chu stresses that prayer is for us to fellowship with God. It is all about talking to Him.
