_Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies. – Romans 8:33_

Because we are born again, God declares that we are righteous. This is based entirely on the death of Christ. By believing in the Lord Jesus, we are justified.

Adapted from __[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ,](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")__ page 47.
