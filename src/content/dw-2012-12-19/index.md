_And David arose and went with all the people who were with him to Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the Name, the very name of the Lord of hosts who is enthroned above the cherubim._ _â€” Second Samuel 6:2_

After David had captured Jerusalem, he sought to bring the ark of God into it. The ark had been in the house of Abinadab ever since the Philistines returned it (1 Sam. 6:1; 7:1). David realized that the kingship and priesthood needed to work together, so the ark had to be brought up so that the people would have a healthy leadership.
