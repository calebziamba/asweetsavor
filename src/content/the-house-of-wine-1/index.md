> He hath brought me to the house of wine,  
> And his banner over me is love.
> 
> \- Song of Songs 2:4 (DARBY)

The house of wine is where all His people enjoy each other and rejoice together, the place where we can be joyful together. Individually, I experience the abundance of the divine life in my personal contact with the Lord. Corporately, all the believers experience the abundance of the divine life in the church. Individually, I sit down in the shade of the Lord as a wonderful apple tree, and His fruit is sweet to my taste; I feel as though I am being raptured. Corporately, I am brought into the banqueting house, the house of wine. I am no longer alone, but with all my brothers and sisters enjoying the Lord and experiencing His riches. I am so joyful, and so are all the brothers and sisters.
