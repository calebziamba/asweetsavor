_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

It is not easy to understand the knowledge and assurance Paul had when he talked about Christ. Although Paul is never mentioned by name in Hebrews, many scholars agree that he was its writer. In Hebrews, the author’s name is nowhere to be found, and from its beginning to end, only the living Christ is seen. In Paul’s other epistles, we can clearly see glimpses of him as a servant of the Lord. Yet in Hebrews, Paul is so absent and Christ is so magnified that some wonder if Paul really was its author. Paul was wonderful—he wrote an epistle magnifying Christ to such an extent that no trace of himself can be found.
