_"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!" — The Song of Songs 1:2_

Our Christian experience begins with, “Let him kiss me.” It begins with love. What a beginning this is! It is not from us but from the Lord. A person may be saved but living a religious life, perhaps just making meetings on Sundays. One day, without any particular reason, there appears a "Him" who takes that person beyond all these things. Oh, this person will now cry, “Let Him! Let Him!” for he is touching the Him in the universe. He now suddenly feels that his life is full of "Him." He doesn't even have to say, “My Lord.” He feels it doesn't need any explanation. When we have Him, our life is different. We are in love. We have His love. Now we love Him, and it seems superfluous to explain.

A person who loves the Lord is sensitive with longing. When he talks about the Lord, he is full of feelings: “He is so precious. He has ravished my heart. I miss Him.” You don't have to tell him how often or how long he should pray. He always feels, “Oh, Lord, I love You.” When he goes to school, he will say, “Lord, I love You.” When he goes to work, he will say, “Lord, I love You. I desire that You would kiss me with the kisses of Your mouth. I long to see You face to face. We are bound together. Oh, Lord, I want to consecrate everything to You.”

This should be your experience all your life. You should live in this feeling all your days. “Let Him.” You do not have to explain who He is. He is the One who has ravished your heart. You and He have an unspeakable, sweet, and sublime relationship.
