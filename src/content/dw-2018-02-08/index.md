There is a great secret to the Christian life, which is simply this: we should never abide in our problems, and we should never condemn ourselves.

As those who are born again, we are often overly sensitive. If anything is wrong with our spiritual condition, we know it immediately, and we feel it intensely. When something is improper in our lives, such as a sin, or a love for the world, we are deeply troubled by it. While there are times when we need to deal with such things in a serious way, we should not focus on such problems, nor should we condemn ourselves. Rather, we should immediately turn to enjoy Christ as our life.
