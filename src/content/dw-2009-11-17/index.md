_And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know. — First John 2:20_ If you do not understand the Spirit, then you do not know the anointing, for the anointing is totally a matter of the Spirit. We can even say that Christ in His operation is the anointing. If Christ is free to continually operate upon me, then I am a person under the anointing. My living under the anointing equals my living in Christ’s operation.

If I am someone who is under the anointing, then as I am driving my car, Christ is operating; as I am eating, Christ is operating; when I am fellowshipping with the brothers, Christ is operating; when I am gathered with the saints, Christ is operating; and when I am pursuing with the saints, Christ is operating. This experience of the operating Christ is the anointing.
