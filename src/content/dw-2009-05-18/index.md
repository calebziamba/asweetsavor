_For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them. — Ephesians 2:10_ The word “masterpiece” can also be translated “workmanship.” We are now God's masterpiece, God's workmanship. However, this does not mean that the work is complete once we are born again. Rather, for us to become God's masterpiece requires God to work on us continually. After we are born again, God often comes in to “cut” us and to “hammer” us. He works on us and adjusts us according to our measure of life, and He never goes beyond what we can handle. His goal is to transform us into the image of Christ Himself. Now that we are born again, we are in the proper position for God to work on us as His masterpiece.
