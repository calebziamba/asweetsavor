_“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;_ _I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam._ _I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;_ _I have drunk my wine and my milk._ _Eat, friends;_ _Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:1_

In his book on the Song of Songs, Watchman Nee writes that the “friends” here refer to the Triune God. According to John Nelson Darby, the friends are other saints, and the Lord does call His disciples His friends (John 15:15). But regardless how we explain the friends, in our experience we know that the Lord is happy when He gains a group of people, and many are revived and satisfied as they share in His enjoyment. If there are some in a church who are matured, rich in life, and one with Lord, that church will be a place of enjoyment because of them. They are gardens in whom the Lord can enjoy something which others also can enjoy together with Him.
