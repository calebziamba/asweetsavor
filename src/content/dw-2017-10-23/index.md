_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

Abraham could have said, “It seems that I have wasted my whole life. All the experiences of one hundred years seem to be in vain. However, Lord I thank You. You have appeared to me so many times and given me so many experiences. Now I fear You, I worship You, and I love You. I know You are God.” The experience of the called ones is that they only gain God Himself.
