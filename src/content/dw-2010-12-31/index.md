_“I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.” — Song of Songs 2:1_

When the Lord works in us, we will realize that we are very ordinary. We should have a feeling that it is completely due to His mercy that we receive any portion in His work. Only because of this do we have a part in His ministry, and only because of this are we able to render others some help.

Meanwhile, we are also lilies of the valleys. We should learn to look to the Lord. We should realize that it is the Lord who cares for us. It is the Lord who is responsible for us. It is the Lord who revives His church. Every one of us needs to see that on the one hand, we are each a rose of Sharon—we are very ordinary. On the other hand, we are each a lily of the valleys—we trust in God’s care. Although we may have the experience of being in the valleys, we can be assured that God cares for His lilies.

Brothers and sisters, do you know who your Lord is? He is the Lord of the lilies. You are a rose of Sharon and a lily of the valleys. Although you are nobody, God cares for you. Although you are nobody, God is responsible for you and wants to accomplish His work through you. God will hold you until you fully realize that you are a lily of the valleys.
