_The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown._ _– Genesis 6:2, 4_

When we mix the spirit and the flesh or bring the world into the church, God withdraws His hand. He wants to gain those who are pure, one hundred percent for Himself. We should be careful about mixture and be pure. When we read Genesis, we realize that the mighty men are not pleasing to God, yet in our own Christian service, for some reason we desire to produce such mighty men. By mixing the spirit with the flesh, God’s way with man’s way, we marry “the sons of God,” hoping to gain impressive results and be appreciated. Even if we were to baptize twenty people in one day, it should not be to our glory but the Lord’s.
