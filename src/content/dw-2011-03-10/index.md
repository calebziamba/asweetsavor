_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste." — Song of Songs 2:3_ When you enter into the riches of life, your life will manifest these riches. You will be able to be joyful even though you are weak, for this life makes you joyful. The divine life supplies you to remain in your joy. Your failure only helps you go to the Lord, and your weakness only prompts you to obtain more life from the Lord.

When you are abiding in the sphere of life, even bondage becomes something that sets you free. If this is your experience, you have the reality of the heavens in your life.
