> After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, “I thirst!” Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put _it_ on hyssop, and put _it_ to His mouth. So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
> 
> \- John 19:28-30, NKJV

When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, at the end, He said, “Finished.” Finished means what? “I have accomplished everything, accomplished everything. I become a real rock! I become a salvation! I become a Savior! But that is not enough. All those who are saved have to be on this rock builded up together. I want to build the church upon this rock. I finished My work.”
