A number of brothers have served the Lord for many years. Some grow well and others grow increasingly crooked. They have all listened to the same messages and passed through the same trainings, but over the years they have grown differently.

Some brothers grow well and give much cause for joy. They may not see much spiritually, but due to their personalities, what little they see becomes useful not only to themselves, but also to the church. They may not have high revelations or an abundance of riches, but due to their good personalities, they are able to make good use of what they have gained. Thus, both they and the church enjoy much blessing.
