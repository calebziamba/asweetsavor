_It came about when he came near to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife...“Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may live on account of you.”_ _– Genesis 12:11,13_

If we desire to pursue God, He may put us into a situation of spiritual famine similar to what Abraham experienced. The feeling of dissatisfaction comes from Him. This will eventually bring us into a deeper experience in life.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 95.
