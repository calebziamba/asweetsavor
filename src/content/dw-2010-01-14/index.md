_But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them: Men of Judea, and all who are dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. — Acts 2:14

And all those who believed were together and had all things common. — Acts 2:44_ There is a great difference between Biblical teachings and examples. Paul, therefore, often teaches and stresses the matter of oneness. Yet, he does not teach the matter of being in one accord. However, we do see strong examples of one accord with the church in Jerusalem. This local church demonstrated how crucial, practical, and exercised a local church should be. Paul did mention in Romans 15:6 that the saints should be in one accord in their giving thanks and praise to God. Yet this one accord is not related to what we do, but how we all can be filled in spirit and praise God together.

In the beginning of the church we have many examples of the saints being in one accord. They are in one accord in preaching the gospel, eating their food, abiding in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, exalting our Lord Jesus Christ, and being filled in spirit. This is all so positive. Yet this one accord was not from human effort. This one accord came about because the Triune God is the God of oneness and the One who produces the genuine one accord.
