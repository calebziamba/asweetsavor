_Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, having predestined us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will. — Ephesians 1:3-5_

I hope we all will rise up with this realization that only the church is eternal and let everything else go. When I am gone, I trust that another will carry on, and that person also should have the expectation that someone else will be able to go on to carry forward what the Lord has committed to him. What is of eternity, however, is the church. Everything else will fade away. All the movements of the Lord and all the servants of the Lord are of time, but the church is eternal. Brothers and sisters, we have to realize how wonderful it is that we are in the church.
