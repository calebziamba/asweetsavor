We in the churches have to be careful about falling into the snare of Babel. Some may consider the elders as closer to God than they are. Be careful! Some may give themselves to the Lord's service with the hidden motive of becoming manifested. Be careful! Some dream of becoming a speaking brother in the meetings. Be careful! Be careful even of the desire to be useful to the Lord. When we offer ourselves to the Lord, it should be without any condition. We should be very careful of using the word “if,” as in, “Lord, I will serve You if You make me useful.” Such a condition emanates from the world of religious vanity. If this is your case, you need the genuine experience of the stream to free you, for you are not truly in the flow of the divine stream.
