_But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know._ _– 1 John 2:20_

Our teaching should be based on what we have received from the Lord, the spiritual need of the hearers, and how the Lord is leading with His anointing. It should bring people to the Lord and elevate them to a higher level in their spiritual life.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 152.
