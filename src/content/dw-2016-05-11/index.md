_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

In the body of Christ we eventually discover that, regardless of how capable we may be, each of us is still only one member. Once we see the body of Christ, our understanding changes. We have the sense that we need the other members, and we begin to be able to regard others as more important than ourselves (1 Cor. 12:12–26).
