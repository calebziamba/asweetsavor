_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

To be saved by the life of God is the reality of organic salvation. Sanctification, transformation, and glorification cannot be separated from salvation by His life. We can be sure that we are growing and advancing in these three as we experience salvation by His life.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 16.
