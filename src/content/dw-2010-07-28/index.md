_Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven." — Exodus 17:14_ It seems these things were written particularly for Joshua after he triumphed on the battlefield and returned from battle to great fanfare. Moses then may have spoken in his ear, “Joshua, the Lord has required that I write something in a book and read it to you. Do you think you won the victory? It is God who won the victory!” Joshua would have to admit that if Moses had not lifted up his hands, he would have been defeated. Due to Moses’ prayer, his sword became sharp. We are needed on the battlefield, but our experience, labor, and fruit are all due to the prayer of the heavenly Christ and His interceding believers. Without them, we could do nothing. This is a lesson we must learn from the very beginning of our service, even to the end of our days.
