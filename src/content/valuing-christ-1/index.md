> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord...
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8a

When Paul said he was counting all things loss for the surpassing value of knowing Christ, it meant he was pursuing Christ so that he might know Him in all aspects: who He is; what He has accomplished; what He is doing; our eternal status in Christ; our subjective experience in Him; our stand in Him, etc. All such things can be said to be the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus our Lord.
