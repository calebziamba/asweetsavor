_“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

Before we began to love the Lord, although we had friends, we were lonely because we were not built together with them. When we had only friends, we would get together when we had a common interest, but when that disappeared, we went our separate ways. In contrast, once we found the virgins, we found genuine fellowship.

by Titus Chu, page 24.
