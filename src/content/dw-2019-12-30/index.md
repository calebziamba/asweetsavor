_“I am the rose of Sharon,  
 The lily of the valleys.”  
– Song of Songs 2:1  
_

Every young saved one feels he is the most hopeful believer and expects to be someone extraordinary. Every saint hopes he will have a certain manifestation in the church life. No one is willing to be ordinary. Suppose the brother who helped you to love the Lord tells you, “You will be hopeless.” Would you still have any desire to pursue the Lord? You may think, in response, “Why should I pay the price to love the Lord, since I will still be hopeless?” Such a thought indicates that your focus is still on yourself instead of on the Lord and that you are living in the religious world. In contrast, once you realize that you are a rose of Sharon, you will know that you are not special in the church life. Among those who follow the Lord, you will become the most unassuming one.
