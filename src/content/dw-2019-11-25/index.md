_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son_  
_–_ _Romans_ _1:1-3_

In clarifying this gospel, Paul says that it is “concerning His Son” (v. 3). Many Christians may think the gospel merely involves bringing people to salvation by persuading them to believe into Jesus. This is not wrong, but the Bible points to the gospel being more than a process to save people. In fact, the meaning of the gospel is far higher, deeper, and richer than getting people saved. The gospel is revealed in the Bible as a living person, the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord!

Those who have the Son of God have the gospel, and those who do not have the Son of God do not have the gospel. It is very simple! When we preach the gospel, we are in fact preaching the Son of God. The purpose of our gospel preaching is to bring people to the Son of God, so that they could live for Him. This is “gospel”! Jesus Christ is the complete reality, substance, and manifestation of the gospel.

The gospel fully encompasses the Son of God. He is not only the center, focus, and reality of the gospel, but the One who controls it, allows it to grow, and who is its ultimate destination. In a very simple way, the gospel is the Son of God Himself, Jesus Christ our Lord.
