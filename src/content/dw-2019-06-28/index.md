_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

It is not so much our speaking that renders real help  
to others but our being in life, for it is a person in life  
who affects others. Because of us, others will say to  
the Lord:  
  
_“We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine.”_
