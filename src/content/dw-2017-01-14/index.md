_We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them._ _– Ephesians 2:10_

After we are born again, God often comes in to “cut” and “hammer” us.He works on us and adjusts us, according to our measure of growth in the divine life, to transform us into the image of Christ. Now that we are born again, we are in the proper position for God to work on us as His masterpiece.
