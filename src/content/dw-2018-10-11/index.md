Paul’s life was a life of seeking fellowship, yet the Bible rarely indicates that he sought some decision during fellowship. He made a determined effort to fellowship with the church in Jerusalem (Acts 9:26; 15:2; 21:15; Gal. 1:18; 2:1; Rom. 15:25–27). Only one of these times involved seeking a decision. Some from Judea were trying to force circumcision upon the Gentile believers in Antioch (Acts 15:1), so Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem to clear up this matter, and a positive decision was reached (Acts 15:2–29).
