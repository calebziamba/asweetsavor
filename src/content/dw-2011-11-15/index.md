_“He brought me to his banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:4_

Brothers and sisters, it is normal for a newly saved one to be self-centered. A new believer’s experience and enjoyment of the Lord are not focused on the Lord but on himself. He seeks his own satisfaction, not the Lord’s.His concern is about what he needs, not what the Lord needs. In his Christian life what he wants, what he asks for, and what he is concerned about are himself. Thus we might say that he is just using the Lord, but his using of the Lord brings him into the Lord’s presence.

Praise the Lord that He tolerates such a situation. Indeed, He is even very happy about it. He invites us to touch His love, to use Him, to enjoy Him, to experience Him, to come into His chambers, to experience the cross, to let Him be King, to know the church, and eventually to know about the self. The Lord is happy if we enjoy His provisions in such a way, even if we are being self-centered.
