Before being born again we “lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind” (Eph. 2:3). But in our new position we are free from our flesh, so that it can no longer bind us. Galatians 5:24 says,

_Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires._
