_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

True service is the result of the Lord’s appearing to us. We met the Lord and touched Him. We cried because His love encouraged us. Because He was so wonderful, precious, and loving, He captured our heart.
