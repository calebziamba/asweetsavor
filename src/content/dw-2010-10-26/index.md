_O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; Nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me. — Psalm 131:1_

When we come to this experience we have gained some maturity. In Psalm 128, the last psalm from the stage of enjoyment, we were likened to a vine tree and an olive tree. This means that our growth in life had a certain manifestation. Our labor was fruitful and productive. Wherever we went, people received help. People appreciated us, and may even have followed us. This seems quite glorious. However, when we are like this, there is the danger that we will think we are “somebody.”
