_A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless the Lord, all servants of the Lord, Who serve by night in the house of the Lord! Lift up your hands to the sanctuary And bless the Lord! May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth. — Psalm 134:1-3_

The servants here are standing in “the house of Jehovah,” which today is the church life. The Lord will not come back because of one individual’s maturity. The Lord will only come back when the entire church has entered into maturity and has expressed the desire for Him to return.

In Psalm 134 all the saints in the church life display maturity. They are all servants of the Lord. They are all crying out together, “Lord, come back! The night has been too long!” Even after we have entered into the highest enjoyment in the church life we should still seek something more. Even when we are enjoying the divine anointing and the freshness of Christ in resurrection, we should still say, “Lord, come back. Yes, we have the highest enjoyment, but Lord, we are not satisfied. We still expect something even more glorious to come. Oh Lord, we stand and wait for Your return!”
