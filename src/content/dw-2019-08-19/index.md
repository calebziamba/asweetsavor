_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

The Triune God wants to work in us. Since we like ornaments and we like to be well-known, God will make us plaits of gold. We made up our own hair before, but now God comes to “weave” His disposition into us. Before our spirituality and beauty were merely human, but now God comes to constitute His own beauty into us, enabling us to express His divinity. Then we will not merely be a lover of the Lord, but also someone who loves the Lord in union with Him.
