_She made a vow and said, "O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever come upon his head." â€” First Samuel 1:11_ God used Hannah and Samuel, the boy she offered, to draw closer to His goal. Now He needed one more person to bring in the man who would be after His heart.
