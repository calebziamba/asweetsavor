_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._ _– Philippians 1:1_

_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_  
  
Suppose we visit a family four or five times with the hope of sharing the gospel with them. They may be happy to see us, but show no interest in the Lord. If our reaction is to conclude, “I’ve tried and tried. There isn’t any hope for these people,” then it is not the family that is hopeless but our labor, because we are not laboring with a commitment.
