_The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him._ _– Romans 8:16-17_

To inherit is to be joined to the Lord and live in the Spirit’s revelation. Some believers confuse their inheritance with success in Christian service. They look to be promoted and appreciated by others, which may only puff them up. They are like slippery fish which no one can catch and only bring headaches to others. They need someone to shake them and wake them up. We just don’t know what to do with such slippery fish. They waste their time and hinder the Lord’s work. They are distracted from their inheritance, and they distract others also. Such slippery serving is the scariest. Those who live in the enjoyment of their inheritance may not be as manifest in their service, but they have been enriched with the Spirit’s revelation and in their experience of Christ.
