_I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. — Song of Songs 1:5_

The Lord's seeker says here, “I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.” After seeing the virgins (1:3), the seeker realized that the daughters of Jerusalem were not only saved but also living in the church life. Then, after intimate fellowship with the Lord, she begins to know who the Lord is, who she herself is, and where the brothers and sisters are.

When she was first with the virgins, she only saw that others were black, but she didn't see that she was also black. Now, after the Lord has brought her into His chambers, she realizes that she herself is black. Originally, she didn't feel so much a sinner, but now she realizes that she is indeed a fallen sinner. Now she has the realization, “Lord, I am black. I can neither do anything nor function in the church life.”
