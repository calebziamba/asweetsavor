_Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will. — Ephesians 1:4-5_

Before God could gain David, David had to experience a number of things. First, he was chosen by God from among his brothers, which was confirmed through Samuel (1 Sam. 16:10–12).

According to the apostle Paul, God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, having predestined us to be His sons (Eph. 1:4–5). Before anything existed, we were already chosen in Christ. The destiny decided for us beforehand was that we would be God’s sons. Paul’s realization was that he had been separated unto the Lord from his mother’s womb (Gal. 1:15). This should be our realization as well. We are different from everyone else, for we have been chosen by God.
