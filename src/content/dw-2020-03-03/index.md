_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

Many know how to speak the right language, but they do not know how to follow Christ. How many can honestly say, “I am where I am and I am doing what I am doing because the Lord has led me this way”? Religion hides our true condition. This is why it is so difficult for the Lord to have the preeminence among us. It is much easier to follow a practice or teaching than to come to the Lord Jesus, yet it is His desire that we would know Him. We should learn from Paul that our goal as Christians is to live in oneness with Christ.
