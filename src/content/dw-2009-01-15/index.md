_Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the knees. Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water reaching the loins. — Ezekiel 47:4_ The next measurement results in waters up to the loins. I once visited a place that was on the ocean, and seeing others swimming, I decided to walk out into the waves to experience what I could. When I went out to knee-depth and further, I began to notice a difference. It was somewhat frightening to me, for I could sense that the water was trying to move me. Those who have tried to cross a river with a strong current know what I am talking about. In the midst of such a strong flow, you can feel quite helpless. Spiritually speaking, when you are in such a flow with water up to your loins, the flow begins to carry you. In such situations you realize what the Lord wants to do, and you want the Lord to have His way, yet you still cling to your moorings. At this point you realize the consequences of being carried in the flow, and you cannot totally yield yourself. Now that you are really in the flow, you realize that you need the Lord's mercy, because you recognize your weakness in following Him.

At this stage, the begetting ability also begins to be manifested, for the loins are related to begetting (Heb. 7:10). When the water is up to your loins, it means that you have become more dependent upon God as you struggle to yield to Him. When you are measured and possessed by the Lord to this extent, you begin to have the ability to minister life to others.
