_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

The Greek word for “consolation” here begins with the prefix _para_. This indicates that consolation, like encouragement, is not merely a matter of words. Consolation requires that we invest our person in what we speak.
