_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

In verse 16, the Greek word for “rejoice” is _kaúchçma_, which means “boast, glory, or rejoice” (Strong, no. 2745). The Philippians’ holding fast to Christ would become Paul’s boast in the day of Christ. Such a boast would not be mere bragging, for the Philippians had gained Christ through Paul’s labor.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 132-133.
