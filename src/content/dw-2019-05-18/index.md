_“For your love is better than wine.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2_

If the Lord were to reveal His glory to us all at once, we could not survive. When the Lord appeared to Isaiah, he said, “Woe is me, for I am undone!” (Isa. 6:5, Heb.).  
The Lord cannot fully reveal Himself to us when we are just beginning to love Him, so He appears to us in His love. Thus, at the beginning of our Christian life, our first experience is of His love. In this love He attracts us and draws our hearts to pursue Him. When we pray to Him just a little, “Let Him kiss me,” He comes immediately.
