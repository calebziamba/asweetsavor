Before we were born again, we were under the authority of Satan, God’s enemy. According to the Bible, Satan has a kingdom on this earth. In Matthew 12:26, Jesus says,

_If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?_

All those who have not been born again are in Satan’s kingdom and under his authority. That is the reason why Paul was commissioned by the Lord to turn people from “the dominion of Satan to God.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ,](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 38-39.
