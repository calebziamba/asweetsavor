> Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”
> 
> \- Galatians 4:6

The Old Testament says: “I am God. Worship Me, honor Me, do things according to who I am, according to My desire.” This is the Old Testament, but the New Testament shows an indwelling Lord. ... Christians can say, “We’re in the New Covenant. Where is God? In my spirit. Where is He living? In my spirit. What is He doing? Operating in my spirit. What is His desire? To grow in my spirit and in the spirit of many Christians. Together we have an inward Christ--an inward, life-giving Lord.”
