_Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need._ _– Hebrews 4:16_

When we fall, God encourages us to return to Him with boldness to receive mercy and grace (Heb. 4:16). He changed from “go away from Me” to “come to Me.” This is God’s way of working with man in the age of the new covenant.
