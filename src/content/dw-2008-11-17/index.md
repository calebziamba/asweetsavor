_I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh._ _— Ezekiel 36:26_

In the moment we were born again and received a new life, we also received a new heart. We must realize that before we were saved our heart was a heart of stone. Before we believed in the Lord, our human spirit was dead. It is in our human spirit that we receive the life of God. Before we were born again our spirit was dead, and our heart was like stone to the things of God. But after we were born again we received a new heart. This new heart is called a “heart of flesh.” It is a heart that is tender and sensitive, and it is filled with feeling towards God.
