_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

No matter how heavy our spiritual burden is or how wide-ranging our spiritual work is, all the relevant spiritual principles can be found in The Song of Songs. These eight chapters are so rich that every verse and every sentence can be applied to our situation and can become our help.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, pages 11-12.
