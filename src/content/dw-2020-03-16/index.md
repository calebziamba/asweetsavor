_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,  
set apart for the gospel of God Which He promised beforehand  
through His prophets in the holy Scriptures"  
\-Romans 1:1-2  
_

The Old Testament is full of gospel messages that contain the promise of Christ.

In the books of the Prophets, there are even more promises regarding Christ. Isaiah prophesied that a virgin would conceive and bear a Son,  and He would be called Immanuel, meaning, “God with us” (Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:23). Jeremiah prophesied that the Christ is the Branch of righteousness, and that He would be our righteousness (Jer. 23:5–6). Ezekiel prophesied that Christ is the One sitting on the heavenly throne in glory, yet with the appearance of a man (Ezek. 1:26–27; Rev. 3:21). Each prophecy was a further unveiling of the promise of Jesus Christ,  the gospel of God.
