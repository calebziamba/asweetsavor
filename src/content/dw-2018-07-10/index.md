_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren._ _– Romans 8:29_

Though God works in people in many ways, all these ways are according to His will and economy. What is this will and economy? Romans shows us three aspects:

1\. God wants to make us His many sons. 2. God wants to make us the body of Christ. 3. God wants the body of Christ to be manifested through many local churches.

All of God’s work in us is unto these three aspects.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 11.
