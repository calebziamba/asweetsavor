> _But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)_
> 
> \- Ephesians 2:14-15, NASB

To be _made alive_ is a manifestation of having visions and revelations. How do you know you have a vision? Let me ask you a question: Are you alive? If you are a Christian alive before the Lord, then you are a man in visions and revelations.

Excerpt from [Message 11 - The Apostle Peter (2)](https://youtu.be/Uy49O5PrPXw?t=1029) of the video message series [Visions & Revelations](http://english.thechurchincleveland.org/virtual-lords-day.html) by Titus Chu
