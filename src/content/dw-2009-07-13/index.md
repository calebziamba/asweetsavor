_I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. — John 10:11_

_I am the good Shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me. — John 10:14_

Fourth, we should enjoy Christ as the good Shepherd. John 10:11 says, “I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.” Then John 10:14 says, “I am the good Shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me.”

When He was on the earth, the Lord's shepherding even reached the point of forsaking His life for us on the cross. Now He is the good Shepherd in the heavenly places. He has ascended and is enthroned with authority, kingship, and lordship. As such a One He is shepherding us today. He shepherds us outwardly by sovereignly arranging our lives. He shepherds us inwardly by ministering Himself to us in the midst of our situations. We don't have to fear or worry about His shepherding, because Christ is a good Shepherd.
