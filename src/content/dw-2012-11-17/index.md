"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

The self-life is always waiting to be displayed. Our self-life always wants to stand out from everyone else. If we give one good testimony, if we give life in one meeting, or if we get one person saved, then what should be a marvelous blessing from the Lord becomes a trap to us.

Our good speaking can kill us. Our fruitfulness can kill us. The blessing we have received can kill us. It is very hard for us to be in Christ. If the Lord blesses us, we think we are somebody, but if the Lord doesn’t bless us, we become discouraged. We must learn from the Lord. The way for us to serve the Lord is just to be buried.

Receiving honor goes against the principle of being buried. As we are laboring we must do our best to remain hidden. Good reports may come, but we must not allow them to lead us to self-glory. We must stay in the principle of being a seed. This is how we may serve the Lord effectively.
