_"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” - Genesis 28:15_

The more we experience the Spirit’s breaking work, the more God constitutes Himself into us. Peter writes, “After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you” (1 Pet. 5:10). We cannot walk the way of the Lord without experiencing the Holy Spirit’s breaking. Even in the world, those who are successful must go through struggling and hardship. Those who suffer in the Lord become strong and useful in His hands. Praise the Lord that He will never let go of us! He will keep working on us, causing us to grow and mature.
