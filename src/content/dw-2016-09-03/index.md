The Spirit has to work in us so that we have the sense of life and the awareness of life regarding our character. The transformation of life doesnâ€™t just change our view or our way of handling things. The transformation of life is when our personality matches the living, growth, and conformation of the divine life and its manifestation in our life, so that our person can be useful to the Lord.
