_We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them._ _– Ephesians 2:10_

Although, once we are born again, we are God’s “workmanship” or “masterpiece,” this does not mean that His work on us is complete. Rather, for us to become God’s masterpiece requires God to work on us continually, all the rest of our lives.
