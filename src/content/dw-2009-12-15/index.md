_And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it. — Colossians 4:17_

Besides a lack of constitution, another reason a person may be unable to supply life is that he does not fulfill his ministry before the Lord properly. Instead, he ignores, or neglects, his ministry. If his spirit is weak, if he does not respect his portion, or if he does not live in life and in the nourishing of the riches of life, he will not be a dependable source of life-supply to others.

Thus, we must be able to use our spirit to supply life to the spirits of others. In the process, we need the Lord’s mercy and should ask that He would continually constitute us with His life. It is not an easy matter to speak for the Lord. If we are careless and if we are not experiencing the constituting work of the divine life in our daily life, we should not expect to be able to supply life to others through our prophesying.
