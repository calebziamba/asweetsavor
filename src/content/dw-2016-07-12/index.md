In considering our personality, we can say, for example, that being exact is a good character trait. We need to ask ourselves, “Am I punctual? Am I precise in handling things?” Strictness is a good character trait as well. A strict person doesn’t easily let go of the affairs placed in his hands. Diligence, magnanimity, and fineness are also excellent character traits.

If we want to follow the Lord, we must know that it is through our character that the divine nature may be constituted into our personality. Without a good character, regardless of how good our nature is, we will be very limited before the Lord. We must allow the divine nature to go through our character so that it may develop our personality.
