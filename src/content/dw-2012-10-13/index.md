_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

If we serve the Lord as if it were a worldly career, then we won’t allow ourselves to be buried. Instead, there will still be some part of us that we will try to keep alive, because for some reason we just cannot go through this first step.

Again, the first step in serving the Lord effectively is this: “Lord, I am a seed. I want to be hidden. I want to be buried. I want to die.” This is completely different from picking up a career in the world. If someone is serving a worldly institution, then his desire, talent, ability, and energy are all useful. But once a person decides to serve the Lord, he must realize, “My talent needs to die. My ability needs to die. My zealousness needs to die. My energy needs to die. Everything I have, everything I am, everything I can do, it all has to die. I must be a proper seed; I must die, and then I can grow.” This is the first prerequisite for serving the Lord.
