_When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.”_ _– John 21:15_

Often, we think that our problem is our self, but the real problem is that we don’t have a lamb to care for. Don’t say, “I was just recently saved. How can I care for anyone else? I’m the one who needs feeding and shepherding.” If we are young in the Lord, then as one young lamb we can care for another young lamb. Surely there are some lambs in our local church for us to feed.
