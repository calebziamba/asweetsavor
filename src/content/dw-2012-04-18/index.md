When I was accepted into my first university, I realized that this could be another field of labor. I rented a room near the campus and began to preach the gospel to the students there. Eventually many got saved.

I first came to the United States in 1963. I worked with one couple, and by the Lordâ€™s mercy, from there the work developed into dozens of churches with thousands of Christians in the Great Lakes area, opening for me a large field to labor in.

We should not be satisfied with just living as good churchgoers who obey church leaders and give weekly tithes. Nor should we merely be involved in carrying out activities. Activities will help us develop a skill, but they may not teach us to trust the Lord or care for others. If we are not actively involved in a field of labor, we will simply maintain a good church life, thinking everything is marvelous, when so much more is possible. Therefore, we all should seek a field of labor in our local church to help us know Christ and invest in others.
