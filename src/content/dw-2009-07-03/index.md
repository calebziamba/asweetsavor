_When Jehovah turned again the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream.... Turn again, O Jehovah, our captivity, Like the streams in the south. Those who sow in tears Will reap with a ringing shout. He who goes forth and weeps, Bearing seed for scattering, Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout, Bearing his sheaves with him. — Psalm 126:1, 4-6_

_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. — John 12:24_

The Lord Jesus was one who sowed Himself into the ground to die; if we wish to be fruitful, then we also must go and die. Psalm 126 is very deep. First there is an initial enjoyment, but then there is a deeper consecration. In this consecration the Lord does not demand that we do anything. He only demands that we die.

The Lord doesn't ask us to serve Him. Instead, He asks us to sow ourselves into the ground, just as He did. When we do this, the result is that we “reap with a ringing shout.” Death and burial is not the end. When we sow ourselves into the ground, we will reap something. When we sow in tears, we will reap in joy! Praise the Lord for this!
