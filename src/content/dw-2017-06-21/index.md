_You are My friends if you do what I command you._ _– John 15:14_

We often have the concept that the Lord is far above us, observing us, waiting for us to fall. It’s as though He has a rod in His hand and is ready to punish us if we displease Him. Our thought is that if we come to His presence, His only question will be, “Have you misbehaved? Have you done anything wrong today?” Thankfully, we do not actually have such a Lord. If we did, we would all be in trouble!

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 76.
