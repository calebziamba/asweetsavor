_And so it was, whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David would take a harp and play it with his hand. Then Saul would become refreshed and well, and the distressing spirit would depart from him. — First Samuel 16:23_

The Lord allows things to happen to us so that we may grow. If we never experienced difficulties or failures, our training might make us appear to be very prevailing when in fact we are not experiencing anything real. Therefore, God does not always allow things to go smoothly for us.

When difficulties came to David, he trusted the Lord and rested in Him. As David played his harp to soothe Saul, he knew that the Lord was at work to carry out what He desired for him. We all should be able to tell the Lord, “I know everything is in Your hands,” and be restful.
