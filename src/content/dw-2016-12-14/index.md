_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1_

Since Christ is our portion, we can gain Him through all our various circumstances (Phil. 3:8; 4:11–13). We all have different experiences. Some are high and some are low or difficult. In whatever circumstance we find ourselves, God’s will is for us to gain Christ.
