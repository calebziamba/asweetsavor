All the riches of Paul’s epistles are based on, unlocked by, and obtained through the experiences of Romans. When people experience God’s complete salvation and allow God to work upon them, they will be able to easily understand and enter into the truth of Ephesians. They will easily have the same mind and heart as Paul when they read Philippians and will eagerly await the Lord’s coming when they read 1 and 2 Thessalonians. Romans has a high value for us today because, as the revelation of God’s complete salvation, it is the foundation for the rest of Paul’s epistles.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; page 13.
