_So \[Isaac\] built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.  
__– Genesis 26:25_

It is too easy for us to settle down. We prefer living in a house instead of a tent. After Christian workers have some success, they may become comfortable and so fixed that even God cannot move them.  
  
When we serve the church, we offer the portion we have received from the Lord. Just because we have helped new believers grow in the Lord, however, does not make them our possession.  
  
No one belongs to us. When we think that a work, a church, or a group is our asset, we are in danger of becoming settled and of no longer living a life of the altar and tent.
