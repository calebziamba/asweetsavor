_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... â€”Philippians 2:1_

If we want to console others, we must value them as if they were our own children. When we treasure others with this kind of _agape_ love, we no longer react merely to human need. Before the Lord, we consider their situation from every angle and take precautions on their behalf, seeking what is best for them. We essentially give up our own rights so that they may grow in Christ. If we possess this kind of love, we will be able to offer genuine consolation to others.
