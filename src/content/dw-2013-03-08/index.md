_“Awake, O north wind,_ _And come, wind of the south;_ _Make my garden breathe out fragrance,_ _Let its spices be wafted abroad._ _May my beloved come into his garden_ _And eat its choice fruits!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:16_

The seeker recognizes that her garden is the Lord’s. First she says, “Blow upon my garden.” Then she says, “Let my beloved come into his garden.” She knows that she belongs to the Lord and the Lord belongs to her.

Her experience is that of being in union with the Lord. Her assurance is not merely that of her salvation being eternally secure, nor of only being a child of God. She realizes that she exists for the Lord’s satisfaction.
