> But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 3:18

The New Testament is “the New Man’s transformation.” God says, “Now, I just change you. How do I change you? Sometimes you don’t even know it.” Christians can say, “I love the Lord. I take in His supply. I don’t know what has happened, but after a period of time, people see me, they tell me, ‘Hey, you are so different!’ I don’t even know I’m different!” What is that? A change of life.
