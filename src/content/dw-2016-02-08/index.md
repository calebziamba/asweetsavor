When we were born again we received not only a wonderful new life in Christ, but also a wonderful new position. Colossians 1:13 tells us,

_He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son._

According to this verse, before we were saved we were in one place, the domain of darkness, but now we have been transferred into another place, the kingdom of Godâ€™s beloved Son.

What a marvelous change is this! In order to fully appreciate our new position, however, we must first be clear about the position we left behind, so in the coming days we will look at the different aspects of the negative position we were in before we were born again.
