In order to cultivate the healthy personality, we must constantly spend time with the Lord, touch the Lord, reconsecrate ourselves to the Lord, and live for the Lord. The stronger our consecration is, the more useful our personality will be to the Lord. We must see that the personality that is useful to the Lord is the result of treasuring, protecting, and growing in the divine life.
