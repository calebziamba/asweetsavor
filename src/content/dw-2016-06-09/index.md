_The one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him._ _– First Corinthians 6:17_

To say we are “joined to the Lord” and “one spirit with Him” means that after being born again, we are joined to the Lord in our human spirit. This is also seen in Romans 8:16, which says,

_The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God._

Where does the Spirit of God testify? In our human spirit.
