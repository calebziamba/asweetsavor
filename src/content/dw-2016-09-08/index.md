When a brother has a disposition that is naturally righteous, he will still be righteous and not crooked when he is transformed. If he becomes crooked, it means he has become fallen.

You have to know that maturity will not abolish your inborn nature. You may be righteous, but you should be constantly in the Lordâ€™s presence asking the Lord in His mercy to deal with your natural righteousness so that it can become a divine righteousness. Otherwise, your natural righteousness will always be a limitation to you. This is not something that is easy to perceive.
