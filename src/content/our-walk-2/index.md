Our walk should be with a clear goal—to gain Christ as our prize. This is our stoicheō walk. It is governed by the goal of pursuing and gaining Christ to the fullest extent so that we might win “the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 3:14).

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 233
