_But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. These are the records of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God._ _– Genesis 6:5-6_

Because Noah found favor in the sight of God, God spoke to him, giving him His living word (vv. 13–21). If we don’t want to be weak, we must walk with God by calling upon His name in spirit and living in fellowship with Him. If we want to be God’s testimony and serve Him, we must also have the living word of God, without which we can do nothing.
