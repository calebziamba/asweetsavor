_“My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh  
Which lies all night between my breasts.”  
– Song of Songs 1:13  
_

One who does not know the cross does not yet really know what it means to love the Lord. When he touches something, he may shout, “Now I see it! Hallelujah, Amen!” Yet afterwards, he will still live his life in his own way. In contrast, one who truly follows the Lord realizes the meaning of “night” and has only one desire, that is, that the morning would dawn.

Only those who realize that they are in the night need the Lord’s death, represented by the myrrh. If you don’t feel you are in the night, death does not have much opportunity to operate in you, so there will be little of the deeper working of the cross. A person who truly follows the Lord only desires the Lord’s return. He lives only for the Lord. Since he realizes he is living in the night, earthly ties do not entangle him.
