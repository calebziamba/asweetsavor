> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 2:14-16, KJV

Paul gives a very strong conclusion when he says, “And who is competent for these things” (2 Corinthians 2:16). People can touch our spirit, and they realize it is serious. Sometimes, people come to the church meeting and it just makes no difference; I can come tomorrow, I can come next week, this is just one of my groups. Some meetings when people walk in, right when they walk in they have the realization: don't touch this group of people. This group of people will either gain your whole life, or will ruin it. When people walk into the meeting, when people confront you, they should begin to realize, “Wow, here is some savour! I will either live or I will die.”
