What price is too unreasonable? If it is for Christ and for Christ alone, the result will be something of the highest value. Madame Guyon (1648–1717) was imprisoned many years for her faith. While in prison, she wrote,

_A little bird I am,_ _Shut from the fields of air,_ _And in my cage I sit and sing_ _To Him who placed me there._ _– Songs and Hymns of Faith, no. 2810_

She had learned to live unto Christ alone.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 145-146.
