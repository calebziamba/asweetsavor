_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith._ _â€“ Philippians 3:8-9_

We can be found in many things, but how often can we be found in Christ? Many times, we are found in our occupation, our success, or our money. At other times, we are found in the things we enjoy, such as athletics, the arts, or hobbies. But Philippians tells us to be found in Christ. When people find us, they should find us in Christ.
