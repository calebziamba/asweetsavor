_“Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name.”_ _– Genesis 11:4_

We may think rebellion is fighting with people or losing our temper. However, these things are not rebellion but merely our weakness, the expression of our sinful nature in Adam. Our self, which is related to our soul-life, is more dreadful than our sinful nature. The self is the origin of rebellion.
