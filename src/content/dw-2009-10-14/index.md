_Feed My lambs....Shepherd My sheep....Feed My Sheep. —John 21:17, 18, 19_

The third and final commission from Christ is found in John 21:15-17. That commission is to “feed My lambs” (v. 15), “shepherd My sheep” (v. 16), and “feed My sheep” (v. 17).

From the moment we are born again, we should learn how to feed and shepherd someone. No one is too young in the Christian life to learn this. Don't say, “I just got saved. How can I care for anyone else? I'm the one who needs feeding and shepherding.” If we are young in the Lord, at least we can take care of another young lamb.
