##### Peter’s Ministry Focused on the Crucified Jesus and Resurrected Christ

Peter’s ministry focused on Jesus being crucified and being made Christ. This was the substance of his messages in Acts. And through Peter’s preaching, thousands were added to the church. His message was direct and powerful: “This Jesus, whom you have crucified, God has made both Lord and Christ! You killed the Author of Life, but God raised Him from the dead and we are His witnesses!” His message was very clear. His message was based upon the revelation he had received. Jesus Christ was revealed to him, so Jesus Christ is who he preached, and nothing else. Oh, it is not an easy thing to preach Jesus only; it is much easier to preach Christ “plus”! It should be your vision that decides your message. Those who are spiritual bear this mark.

Because of his revelation, Peter was a person who became bold to the uttermost. On the day of Pentecost, when he walked out to face that huge crowd, the other apostles may have expected to be stoned to death. Peter didn’t care. He stood up and said, “You crucified Him. God has raised Him. You want to kill me also?” Eventually three thousand repented, and his teaching became the teaching of the whole church (Acts 2:42). We must learn to be faithful to what God has revealed to us, regardless what confronts us.

##### Peter’s Living was in and for the Local Churches

Peter applied what he saw of Christ in his ministry. What, though, became the sphere of his living? The local churches.

When Peter first lived among the saints, he performed many notable miracles. To one who was crippled he said, “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk!” (Acts 3:6). I like this kind of person. He may not be able to give you money, but he can give you Christ! And when he gives you Christ, you will no longer be under the bondage of money! You will no longer be under the bondage of sin! You will no longer be under bondage to the world! You will be released to walk, jump, dance, and praise God!

Peter was so prevailing that people even laid the sick in the streets hoping that his shadow might fall upon them so they might be healed (Acts 5:15). This never even happened with the Lord when He was on the earth (cf. John 14:12).

Sometimes when we are with a spiritual man we have this experience. We may come with many questions, but when we come into his presence, our questions disappear. I had this experience with Brother Lee. I had a lot to ask, but when I came into the room and saw him there smiling at me, all my questions disappeared!

##### Peter Was Initially Prevailing as He Applied His Revelation

This was Peter’s situation. His preaching was the most successful. His teaching was the most prevalent. His works of power were the most miraculous. And his leadership was unquestioned. The church, under his leadership, was at peace. It was a wonderful time. The saints were fellowshipping from house to house and were enjoying the fellowship and teaching of the apostles according to Peter’s revelation. New ones were being added to the church daily. We can only guess at how many thousands of believers there were in the church at that time, for in the first instance when Peter spoke, three thousand were baptized (Acts 2:41), and on the second instance it seems another five thousand were saved (Acts 4:4).

Everything seemed so prevailing in the church life. Peter had used the keys delivered to him by the Lord to unlock the truth of the Body of Christ to both the Jews and the Gentiles. Through him, the door of salvation had been opened so that they might both brought into one Body. Peter accomplished this with his visit to Cornelius’ house in Acts 10. Right after this, however, the Bible reveals that something was beginning to change in the church life. In Acts 11:1, Luke writes, “And the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.” Now another influential group appears in the church life besides the apostles, called here “the brothers.” It was those of this group “who were of the circumcision” who disputed with Peter about his going to the Gentiles with the gospel (v.2).

Eventually, as we will see, this Jewish influence continued to grow until we read only about “brothers,” and no longer about any apostles. This all took place within a few years.
