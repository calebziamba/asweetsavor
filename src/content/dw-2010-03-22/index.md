_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_ The third verse of this psalm is one of the most precious verses in the Bible. It is so profound that it is difficult to appreciate. This is a poetic description of environmental dealings and affliction.

Affliction causes us to be made very low, because we are constantly under something we can’t handle. We usually think that our usefulness comes from our being made high and victorious. But from the Lord’s point of view, our usefulness comes from being brought low. For example, we often like to be involved in spiritual activities because they make us feel we are important. We are in the front. But when the Lord puts His hand upon us, He often pushes us to the back. He doesn’t allows us to be so high. This is an example of what it means for the “plowers” to “plow on our back.”
