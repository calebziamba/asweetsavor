_And David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel. Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David._ _— Second Samuel 5:12-13_

After David moved to Jerusalem, he took more wives and concubines. He had three wives already—Michal, Ahinoam, and Abigail. Eventually he had eight wives.

In Deuteronomy 17:14–17, Moses wrote specifically that the kings who would rule Israel should not multiply wives to themselves, lest their hearts be turned away from the Lord. In this matter, David failed.
