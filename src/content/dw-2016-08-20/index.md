_For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?_ _– First Corinthians 8:10_

Paul touched the matter of how young saints can be corrupted when he wrote about the things sacrificed to idols. He said that according to knowledge, an idol is nothing, and food will not commend us to God; we lack nothing if we do not eat it, nor do we abound if we do eat it (1 Cor. 8:4-8). But he also said, “If someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?” (v. 10). Therefore he testified, “If food stumbles my brother, I shall by no means eat meat forever, that I may not stumble my brother” (v. 13).
