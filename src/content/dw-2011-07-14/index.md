_And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. — John 20:22

And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. — Acts 10:45_ The experience of the Spirit can be inward (John 20:22) or outward (Acts 10:45). We can pray to the extent that we are filled with the Spirit. Sometimes when believers pray together and claim the efficacy of the Lord’s blood, sing a chorus of a hymn, and continue to pray until their spirits are elevated, they experience the Spirit’s filling. For one person to seek this individually is difficult, but I hope many would gather in such a way to practice entering into the Lord’s presence.
