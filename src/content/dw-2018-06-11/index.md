In considering our new living, we have so far focused on the enjoyment of Christ in its different aspects, especially in the Gospel of John. Now we want to go on to see how, in this new living, the Lord requires something from us, for our being born again does involve some responsibility. In doing so, we will once again consider the Gospel of John, for this book reveals that Christ has three commissions for us.
