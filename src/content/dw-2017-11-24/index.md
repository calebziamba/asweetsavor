_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

Whatever generation of the world we are in, we must recognize that Satan is its ruler (John 12:31). In every generation, he works to make people crooked and perverse to prevent them from developing into what God desires. We all once walked according to the course of this world, making us fit only for God’s wrath and judgment (Eph. 2:1–3). Satan uses the world to frustrate and divert mankind away from God.
