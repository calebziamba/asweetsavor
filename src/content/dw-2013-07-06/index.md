_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

Why did Paul write to “all the saints”? Why didn’t he write to “the church in Philippi”? The Greek word for “saint” is the same as the word for “holy”—hágios. Paul is writing to all the holy ones. God Himself is holy. We, as saints, are also holy and bear God’s holy nature (Eph. 1:4; 1 Pet. 1:16).

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 15.
