_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

When I see what is contained in these verses, I can hardly believe that we could be as blessed as this. We are blessed as members of the body of Christ, for it is in the body that we run, labor, sacrifice, and serve together. What a wonderful body life!

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 135.
