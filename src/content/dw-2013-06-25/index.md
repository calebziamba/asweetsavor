_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _â€” Philippians 1:1_

The entire beginning of the church life in Philippi was pure and without complication. This produced a close relationship between Paul and the believers there. The saints in Philippi cared for Paul and his need (Phil. 4:16). After Paul left them to preach the gospel elsewhere, they sent a brother to minister to his need (Phil. 2:25). This shows how pure the church was and how pure their relationship with the apostle was.
