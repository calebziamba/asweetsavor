_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

We may be very confident in our disputing and do things according to what we feel is profitable. As a result, the sweetness in the church life disappears, and the supply of life between us dries up.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; page 123.
