_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

The clause “regard one another as more important than yourselves” means to consider others “to be above, be superior in rank, authority, power” (Thayer, p. 641). This can by no means be achieved by human effort. It comes to us through the realization that we need others and that anything we may have is absolutely due to the Lord’s mercy and grace.
