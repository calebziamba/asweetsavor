_Then Samuel died; and all Israel gathered together and mourned for him, and buried him at his house in Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran. — First Samuel 25:1_

Samuel died while David and his men were at the stronghold of En Gedi. If David had not gone through what En Gedi represented, he would not have been prepared for Samuel’s death.

While he was unsettled at Ziph, he still would have felt he needed Samuel. At En Gedi, however, he had come to know the Lord further as the One who is always able to supply him in His resurrection. It seems the Lord was saying, “From now on, David, you shall rely only upon Me.”
