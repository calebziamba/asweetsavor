_Naomi said to Ruth, “Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will turn out; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day.” — Ruth 3:18_

It was now up to Boaz to take care of matters. There was a closer kinsman who had more right than he, so Boaz had to take care of that.

Brothers and sisters, do not fear! Be at peace, for our Boaz will not rest until He has fully done all that He said He would do.
