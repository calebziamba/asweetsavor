_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

The psalmist, by quoting David, applies these words to himself. His own house and God’s dwelling place are the same. How many of us can say this?

We would normally think, “There is God’s house, and there is my house. God has His tabernacle, and I have my own house.” But here in this psalm a mature person declares, “I don’t have my own house. My house is God’s house. I don’t have anything for myself. All that I have is consumed by God for His habitation.”
