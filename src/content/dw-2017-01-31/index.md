_That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._ _– Ephesians 1:18_

We don’t need to struggle to obtain the riches we have in Christ, we don’t need to make up our mind and do our best to receive them, and we don’t need to beg the Lord that we might enter into them, for all of these wonderful aspects of our new position belong to us already.
