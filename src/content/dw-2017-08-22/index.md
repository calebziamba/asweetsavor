_It came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces._ _– Genesis 15:17 (ASV)_

In our experience of life we cannot get away from these two things: a smoking furnace and a flaming torch. The smoking furnace signified darkness and difficulties. Deuteronomy 4:20 says, “The Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from Egypt.” The years that the Israelites spent as slaves in the “iron furnace” of Egypt were dark and difficult. The torch of fire represented light and glory, the opposite of the dark, smoking furnace.
