_I recall your tears._  
_– 2 Timothy 1:4_

Do not look down at people’s tears, because in following the Lord, to have tears is healthy. I am not speaking of emotional tears but of tears that show we are one with the Lord, concerned for the church, and participating in others’ difficulties. Such tears show our tenderness and allow the Lord to lead us further. To be approved as Timothy was, we must know how to cry before the Lord.
