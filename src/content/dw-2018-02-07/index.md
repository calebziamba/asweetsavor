_Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed”; and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit._ _– 1 Corinthians 12:3_

When we call on the Lord’s name or pray over a verse in the Bible, we will feel that our sleepiness is gone, our bad feeling is gone, our depression is gone, our problems and our anxieties are gone, and that everything negative is gone. Why is this? Because we are enjoying Christ as our very life. Suddenly, we will be full of a desire to love and serve the Lord and to spend more time with our brothers and sisters in the church. The more we come to the Lord in this way, the more we will find a tide of life rising up within us.
