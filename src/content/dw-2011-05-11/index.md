_So the women sang as they danced, and said:_

_“Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.”_

_Then Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed only thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?” So Saul eyed David from that day forward. — First Samuel 18:7-9_

Many people who gain a position of influence try to hold on to it, even if it means sacrificing others to do it. Even in the realm of Christian work, we can see how some at times have been willing to sacrifice others in order to protect what they feel is their place.

As we serve the Lord, it is easy to feel that things would be much better if certain people were not there. If they are finally driven out or moved aside, we are peaceful about it, thinking it will now be easier for us to go on. If something has truly been given to us by the Lord, however, we do not have to worry about someone taking it away from us. Instead, we should care for the profit of those who are with us and trust the Lord to carry out what He wants to do, for it is His work, not ours.
