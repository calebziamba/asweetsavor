_“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage.” — Joshua 1:9_

When my wife and I moved to Akron, Ohio, I felt called to serve the Lord. For this reason I was very specific in my prayers concerning our housing. I wanted a house that would allow me to serve the Lord with the least distraction. I asked the Lord for a house close to the church’s meeting hall, with three bedrooms upstairs so the first floor could be used for fellowship, set back from the street so it wouldn’t be too noisy, with a small backyard so I wouldn’t have much to mow, in good condition since I am not a handyman, and low cost since I didn’t have much money.

After I prayed, I was very restful. Soon my real estate agent called and said, “Mr. Chu, your God has prepared a house for you!” There had been a fire, so the house had been repainted and recarpeted. It was a three-bedroom, two-story house. He said, “There is one drawback...the backyard is very small.” Everything was exactly as I had prayed. I thanked the Lord as the One who is so alive! Every time I looked at that house, I was looking at a miracle.

The Lord is so trustworthy! When He said, “Be strong and of good courage,” He also said, “I will be with you.”
