_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste. He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:3-4_

The experience of the first section, which focuses on the Lord’s love rather than the Lord Himself, ends with, “His banner over me was love.” At this point, the seeker has experienced the Lord individually and corporately. The riches of the Lord and the church have brought her to the love of the Lord. Now she realizes she has a banner over her. To whom does she belong? She belongs to a love that will remain over her throughout her entire life.
