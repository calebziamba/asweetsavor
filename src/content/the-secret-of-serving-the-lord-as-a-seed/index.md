_Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.  
— John 12:24_

Immediately after speaking of Himself as a grain of wheat, the Lord went on to speak of how, if we desire to serve Him, we must follow Him (John 12:26). This shows us that if we truly desire to serve the Lord, we must also become “seeds” that fall into the ground and die.

It also shows us that if our heart is ready we can be the good ground for the Lord to come and grow in us.
