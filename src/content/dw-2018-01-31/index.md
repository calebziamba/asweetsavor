_“God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”_ _– John 4:24_

In the Gospel of John, we see that Christ is life to us. He is the bread of life, the water of life, the light of life, and the word of life. He is also grace, reality, satisfaction, and freedom. He is also the resurrection, and He is the true vine. The enjoyment of all these riches will supply us to meet all the needs in our daily life.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 85-86.
