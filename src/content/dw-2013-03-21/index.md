_“Now behold, with great pains I have prepared for the house of the Lord 100,000 talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for they are in great quantity; also timber and stone I have prepared, and you may add to them.” – First Chronicles 22:14_

I hope all who seek to serve the Lord would gather materials for the Lord’s building as David did in all his troubles and afflictions. As we carry out our warfare before the Lord, we should also accumulate the spiritual materials typified by iron, brass, silver, and gold. Outwardly we may experience trouble and affliction, but inwardly we should be gathering precious materials for God’s building (1 Cor. 3:12).
