_How beautiful you are, my darling, How beautiful you are! Your eyes are like doves behind your veil; Your hair is like a flock of goats That have descended from Mount Gilead. — Song of Songs 4:1_

When we have grown in the Lord, He will grant us power so that our speaking and exercise can meet the church’s needs. If we are truly submitting to the Lord, we will receive something from the Lord with which to supply others. Before men we will have power, but inwardly we will experience resting and feeding upon Christ on Mount Gilead.

Power, however, should not be our focus; we should focus instead on obedience. Our concern should be to obey, not to become powerful. We must care more about living before God and obeying Him than we do about manifesting power. If we have a burden and the ability to carry something out, we should not be eager for that. If we are eloquent and persuasive, we should not feel that we must speak. Instead, we should repose before God and function according to His leading.
