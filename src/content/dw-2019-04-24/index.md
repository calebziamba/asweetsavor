_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

Each of us has our own pursuit, our own plan, and our own desire. In this book, however, the Lord tells us we should only evaluate our lives according to our relationship with Him. Only a life spent loving the Lord is a valuable life; only a life spent loving the Lord has eternal value; only a life spent loving the Lord is a life full of enjoyment; only a life spent loving the Lord is the song of songs.  
  
Others are pursuing the joy and the songs of their lives, but the Lord tells us, “Without Me, without My song, without My music, your life is void and empty. It has no value before God, and eventually no meaning on this earth.”

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)  
_by Titus Chu, pages 15-16.
