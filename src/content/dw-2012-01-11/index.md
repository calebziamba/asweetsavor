_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity! — Psalm 133:1_ We have all tasted this oneness from time to time, but it seems we are never able to maintain it. Our experience of oneness is often inconsistent. However, we should not be discouraged and think that oneness is only theoretical. Oneness comes from our maturity in life. It is not theoretical, but it is something we must grow into.

As the Lord continues to transform us and work Himself into us, and as we strive for the Lord to be the substance of the church life so that He can enter into His rest, then eventually the true oneness of the Lord’s testimony will be produced among us. We will have what is spoken of in this psalm: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity!”
