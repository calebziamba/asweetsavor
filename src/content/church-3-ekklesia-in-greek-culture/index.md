The word “church” is used hundreds of times in the New Testament. To the modern reader, the word brings with it an array of mental images ranging from stained glass windows and wooden pews to living room home meetings and people kneeling together in prayer, and everything in between. But what did “church” mean in the Greek culture of the writers of the New Testament?

## Church in Greek Culture

First, let’s consider the Greek word we translate as “church”: _ekklesia._ In the ancient Greek world, _ekklesia_ often referred to a public assembly— whether large or small, formal or informal—which would come together for any purpose, including entertainment or discussion of a shared interest. It may also refer to an assembly called to a public square by royal decree, including the announcement of tax, warfare or the enthronement of a new king. Finally, it was used to refer to an assembly of persons who shared the same faith. For some particular religions, _ekklesia_ was used often in their sacred writings.

Based on the previous paragraph, you may be thinking “It sounds like _ekklesia_ was a pretty broad word!” And you’d be right! In fact, an _ekklesia_ would be involved in all the major aspects of the Greeks’ life: their daily living, their religious living, their sporting competitions, and even their commitment to combat all included some type of _ekklesia_. The _ekklesia_ — the assembly; the church—played a central role in the daily life of the average Greek.

In light of this picture, for many Christians today, the practice of the church should become so much more than attending our regular meetings! It should become our daily living— one where we do not only come together for prayers, or for worship, or even for mutual establishment, but where we love and care for each other in our daily living. In such a living we learn to bear the needs of others (including their families) upon our heart and uplift them in our personal prayers. When we live a proper _ekklesia_, we comfort others and cherish them; We encourage them, cultivate them, and educate them; We help them with their practical needs and their spiritual problems; We form companionships with one another for the benefit of the church. Not only that, but we go from house to house with our companions to visit and care for the people in our community and the other believers in our church. In a healthy _ekklesia_, we even go out together in order to share the good news of Christ and to further God’s will in the Bible with our community and our church. Not only do we love and care for our church locally, but we also show practical and financial love and care for other churches in other cities, and even other countries! We even learn to receive a commitment from God and begin to migrate to other cities or other countries with a view for raising up new churches according to His will. What a wonderful and glorious church life our God has ordained and prepared for all the believers today!
