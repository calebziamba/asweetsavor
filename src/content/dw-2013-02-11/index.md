_“How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!_ _How much better is your love than wine,_ _And the fragrance of your oils Than all kinds of spices!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:10_

In addition to praising His seeker’s love, the Lord also praises the seeker’s fragrance: “How much better is...the fragrance of your oils Than all kinds of spices!”

In the beginning of the Song of Songs it is said that the king’s anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance (1:3), which shows that the Lord has a pleasant fragrance. Here the Lord praises the Shulammite, telling her that the fragrance of her ointments is much better than all spices.
