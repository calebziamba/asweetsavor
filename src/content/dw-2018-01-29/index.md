_“God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”_ _– John 4:24_

Our being born again results in the need for a new living. What kind of living should we have now? One of enjoying Christ as a living person. We should enjoy Christ as the Lamb, as our Friend, as our older Brother, as our Shepherd, as the Builder, and as our Bridegroom.

The more we enjoy Him, the more we have the reality of all these items. We will be cleansed, sustained, and strengthened, and we will have the living and subjective experience of Christ in our daily life.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 85.
