Please sing through the hymn below before continuing.

> **Verse 1**  
> Lord Jesus, when I think of Thee,  
> of all Thy love and grace,  
> my spirit longs, and fain would see,  
> Thy beauty face to face.   

From its earliest appearances in hymnals, this poem has been set both in the singular and plural. Some have all the ‘I’s as ‘we’s and ‘my’s as ‘our’s throughout all five verses. The plural lends itself to group enjoyment, though this song is delightfully personal if sung in the singular. It is hard to know what is original and even the 1881 _Little Flock Hymnal_ used by the Brethren presents the plural. Try both!

> **Verse 2**  
> And though the wilderness I tread,  
> a barren, thirsty ground,  
> with thorns and briars overspread,  
> where foes and snares abound;

As a church planter and leader, Deck was all too familiar with thorns and briars. When the differences between the ‘Exclusive’ and ‘Open’ Brethren became contentious, he attempted reconciliation and [‘his two tracts on the subject won him no friends.’](https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1d8/deck-james-george) After later immigrating to New Zealand and founding many assemblies, he kept these new flocks insulated from the controversies in England. Twenty years later, when Exclusive leaders Darby and Wigram visited the islands, their practice of separating from other Christians was enforced. Deck maintained fellowship with these companions of old, but the assemblies led by his sons did not. Luckily for us and for Deck, this verse does not end with a period but with a semicolon, completing the thought by the next verse.

> **Verse 3**  
> yet in Thy love such depths I see,  
> my soul o'erflows with praise;  
> contents itself while, Lord, to Thee  
> my joyful song I raise.

Despite the many thorns and briars that Deck was familiar with in his labor for the gospel and for the church, verses 3 and 4  show a deep history of looking above the turmoil and finding a powerful balm in the love of our Lord Jesus. When we look away unto Him and peer ponderously into His Person and work, our heart begins to flow. The contentedness and joyful song stirred there will overflow, carrying us through many trials. Oh may we turn, behold Him, and sing of His virtues!

> **Verse 4**  
> My Lord, my life, my rest, my shield,  
> my rock, my food, my light,  
> each thought of Thee doth constant yield  
> unchanging, fresh delight.

Here is the song raised in the last line of verse 3. The contented soul sustains itself with the person and attributes of our Savior. He is at once our Lord and our food, our real rest and our shield. With such a rich character, how can He but meet our every need? One of the precious utterances here is that each thought of Him yields delights that are both unchanging yet fresh. Only He can be the same yesterday, today and forever, and yet the same in His freshness, always crisp, ever new. This Life-giving spirit is always in us a New Man, which is being renewed. (Col 3:10)

> **Verse 5**  
> My Saviour, keep my spirit stayed,  
> hard following after Thee;  
> till I, in robes of white arrayed,  
> Thy face in glory see.

Amen! This is the song of His saints. Musically, this hymn has been paired with a variety of tunes since its appearance in hymnals. Here, it is joined with a light, lilting folk air which sweeps us right into the raised joyful song. The tune is such that the snares and briars of the second verse may pass quickly, and it will draw out hearty singing to keep our spirits stayed and following hard after our Lord!

May this song describe our days! May we be filled with thoughts of our precious Jesus. When we find that our shepherd has brought us into a valley of the shadow of death, raise our joyful song to be one with such a Savior! And may He through His very virtues and grace keep us stayed on Him, following hard upon His footsteps until we see His very face in that Day. Have you found such a song in your wildernesses?
