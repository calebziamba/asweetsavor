_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _— First Corinthians 3:6_

When we are young, we feel that we are ready for anything. As we grow older, however, we begin to realize that whatever we can accomplish is totally a matter of the Lord’s blessing. The move of the Spirit is a totality of His operation through so many believers.
