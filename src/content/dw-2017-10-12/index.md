_Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, so that they bore children._ _– Genesis 20:17_

Those who are spiritual and blameless before the Lord may be weak, yet they are able to bless others with spiritual blessings. Their faith is so great that they don’t look at their own weakness. Even though they know themselves, they see what God sees, do what God does, and want what God wants. They are one with the Lord. If we don’t have Abraham’s faith to overcome our own weaknesses, we cannot bless others. Abraham was able to bless others while he was still in limitation and weakness.
