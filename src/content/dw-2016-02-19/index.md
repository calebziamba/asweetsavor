The Bible tells us that before we were born again, we were slaves to impurity and lawlessness. Romans 6:19 says,

_I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification._ Before we knew the Lord, we were just slaves to impurity and lawlessness.
