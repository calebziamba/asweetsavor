> Not that I have already obtained the prize , or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession of it , seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus . 
> 
> \- Philippians 3:12

Learn to persecute Christ. Tell Him, “I want You more! I need You more! I want to enjoy You, gain You, and apply You more! I want You to be more real and alive to me than ever before! Be everything to me. Otherwise, I will not let You go! I am willing to pay any price to attain to the out-resurrection.”

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 210
