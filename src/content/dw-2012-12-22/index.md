_And David was unwilling to move the ark of the Lord into the city of David with him; but David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. Thus the ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household._ _— Second Samuel 6:10-11_

The ark stayed in Obed-Edom’s home for three months, during which time he and his family were blessed by the Lord (v. 11). Perhaps his business dealings suddenly yielded him a great fortune!

When David heard that Obed-Edom’s family was blessed, he was encouraged to bring the ark into Jerusalem. This time, however, the ark was not placed on a cart but was carried.
