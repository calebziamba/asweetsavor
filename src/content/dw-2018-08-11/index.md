_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

In matters of sin, the fallen world, and our relationships with one another, we need to be saved. God has answered this need by making every person, thing, and environment an opportunity for us to experience the reigning of His life. By these experiences, organic salvation is realized in us.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 16.
