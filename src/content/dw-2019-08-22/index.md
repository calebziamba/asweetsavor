_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

Every time you reach a new peak in your spiritual growth, you need to be prepared for Satan’s renewed attack, and you need to ask for the Lord’s preservation. However, be assured that God will only allow Satan to attack you and test you according to your capacity. Those who lead, those who love the Lord more absolutely, and those who are more committed to the Lord will go through more sufferings. The result of such sufferings, however, will be the woven crown of gold (cf. James 1:12).

In the midst of this process you will often feel unclear, blocked, frustrated, depressed, or simply unable to go on. At such a time, however, the Spirit will constitute you, and the Triune God will work on you, bringing out a further expression of the gold. The more constitution you have, the more plaits of gold; the more gold, the more expression of His glory.
