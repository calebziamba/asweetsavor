> Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:17 NASB

Paul was surely a grand person to give us such a sweet verse. Though he was a marvelous pattern, he did not consider himself the exclusive pattern. Even though he may have been the Lordâ€™s greatest servant, he acknowledged that no matter how useful he was, and how much revelation he had been granted, he was insufficient in himself. Even his many coworkers were not enough. He recognized that there were many others who were walking and laboring in the same principle. Rather than fearing some might snatch the believers away from him, Paul encouraged the believers in Philippi to take as patterns those who walked as he walked.
