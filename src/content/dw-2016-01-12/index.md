_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion...._ _—Philippians 2:1_

The Greek word for “encouragement” in this verse is _paraklesis_. This word begins with the prefix _para_, which means “beside” (Kittel, p. 771). When we properly encourage others, we do not merely encourage them to go on. Rather, something of us goes with them for their going on. In our encouragement, we walk beside them.
