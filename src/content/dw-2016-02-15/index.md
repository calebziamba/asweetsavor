_You were dead in the trespasses and sins, in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience._ _– Ephesians 2:1-2_

The Bible tells us that before we were born again, we were in death. Sin and death are closely related (Rom. 5:12; Eph. 2:1). In the eyes of the world we may have been very busy, doing many things. Because our spirit was dead, however, we had no feeling towards God in our human spirit. Thus, in the eyes of God we were like a walking corpse. We didn’t know where we came from or where we were going. God seemed far away from us.

Only after we were born again did we realize, “All of my life I was actually dead. I thought I was alive all these years, but I was abiding in death. I had no feeling towards God at all until now.” This proves that before we were born again, we were in death.
