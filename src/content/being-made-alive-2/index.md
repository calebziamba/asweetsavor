> _But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)_
> 
> \- Ephesians 2:14-15, NASB

In your existence, you were made alive firstly to Christ--the knowledge of Christ is made alive. I’m saved, so _made alive_ means I enjoy the sweetness and the trustworthiness of my salvation. I’m saved and Christ is such a marvelous Savior, so you can say, Christ was made alive, so He’s my lover, He’s my life, He’s my supply, He’s my strength, He’s my energy, He’s my leader, He’s my direction, He’s the reason of my existence and I live only for Christ.
