When I was young, I felt the church life was for old people, so I only went to young people’s meetings. Then the Lord revealed to me that these old people were my brothers. Therefore, I began to go to the “old people’s” meetings and found them very enjoyable. Besides loving the Lord and the church, I also began to love the church life. That is the priesthood.
