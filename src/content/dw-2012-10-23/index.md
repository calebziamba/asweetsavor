_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

When it comes to the matter of being a seed, we are often extreme. Suppose the Lord tells us, “I don’t want you to do anything. I just want you to be buried and die.” We may respond, “That’s fine; if you want me to go and die, I will go and die.” Then we lock ourselves in a room and cry, “Lord, I’m ready to die. I can do nothing but die. I’m hopeless.” However, when the Lord’s speaking comes to us again and the opportunity for growth comes, for some reason we are very numb; we don’t respond.

A seed doesn’t just stay hidden and then feel sorry for itself. A seed always takes the opportunity to grow. We may say that a little plant grows because the good soil and the weather cause it to grow. However, we may also say that the plant is taking the opportunity to respond to its environment. When the environment is right, it will take the opportunity to grow.

It is the same with us. When a person who is serving the Lord grows in a healthy way, on one hand it is the environment that causes him to grow. But on the other hand he grows because he sees the environment and he takes the opportunity.
