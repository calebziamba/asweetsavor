_We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places — Ephesians 6:12

The whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one. — First John 5:19_ This is the spiritual warfare we are fighting. Therefore, we have to put on the whole armor of God. Put on your local church life; put on the body of Christ. Love Jesus, and love your fellow believers. Give yourself to Jesus, and give yourself to your brothers and sisters. When you are living such a life, you live under its covering and protection.
