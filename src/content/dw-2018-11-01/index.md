_Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches. Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?_ _– 2 Corinthians 11:28-29_

When the believers were weak, Paul was weak. He shared the sensation of their weaknesses and their limitations. Typically we try to ignore those who are needy. Paul was different. He was weak when others were weak.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 148.
