_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._ _– Philippians 1:1_

_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_  
  
Serving as bond-servants requires a commitment that goes beyond how we spend our time; it demands our whole person. Without this, we are merely employees performing a job. Those who are committed invest themselves to the point of being completely overwhelmed. Sometimes well-intentioned people tell me to take a vacation. Yet, how can I rest? I am driven by my commitment.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")
