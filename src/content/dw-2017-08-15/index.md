_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

In his lifetime, Abraham never saw his seed multiply, possess the gate of his enemy, or bless all the nations of the earth. However, he did gain and experience God Himself. His portion was God alone.
