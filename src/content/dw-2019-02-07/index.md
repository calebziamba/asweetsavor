_Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek, and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium._  
_– Acts 16:1-2_

The third factor for Timothy’s approvedness was his recommendation to Paul by the churches he served. Paul first met Timothy while traveling through Asia Minor preaching the gospel and raising up churches. Two local churches, Lystra and Iconium, spoke well of Timothy (Acts 16:1–2). He probably traveled between these churches and served them. Based on this, these two churches spoke well of him, recommending him to Paul.
