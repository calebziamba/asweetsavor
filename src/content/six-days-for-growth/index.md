It’s very interesting: right after the revelation to Peter in Matthew 16, the Bible says, “After 6 days Jesus took Peter, James, and John to the high mountain by themselves.” 6 days. that is very interesting. You know, in Genesis 1 and 2, six days are the days of God’s work. The first day there’s light — you begin to have revelation. The second day, there’s the air — you begin to understand spiritual things. The third day you have land in order to grow some life, which means you have real salvation through light and through spirit. You enjoy this salvation and, eventually, you advance all the way to the 6th day. The 6th day is the creation of man; the day when God finally gained someone. God says, “I’m happy. I’m satisfied.” On the 7th day, God rested. Do you understand God’s operation? Every time that God gives you a revelation it is not for you to become very excited and to shout, “I see something! Praise the Lord, I see something!” Instead, God says, “6 days. Please, spend 6 days. Have some light about it. Have your spirit upon it. Produce the land for the vision you receive to be able to grow.”
