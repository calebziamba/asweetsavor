_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

In order to hold fast the word of life, we must also have a learning attitude. We should be able to receive from others and learn from them. This precious word of life is operating not only in us but also in all other believers. There is so much to receive! When the Thessalonians heard the speaking of the apostle Paul, they welcomed and accepted it as the word of God, and it effectively worked in them (1 Thess. 2:13).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 132.
