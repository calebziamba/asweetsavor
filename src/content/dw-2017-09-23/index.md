_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

On the one hand, Abraham was weak; on the other, God is rich. On the one hand, Abraham found it hard to believe God could give Sarah and him a baby, on the other, he was confident of the all-bountiful God’s supply. How wonderful was his experience!
