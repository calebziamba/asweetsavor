To be approved as servants of the Lord, we must pursue the truth diligently. If we know both the Lord and the Word, others will honor us. Our approvedness will be based on how much we have labored in the truth before the Lord.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 140.
