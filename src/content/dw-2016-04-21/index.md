_“I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.”_ _– Genesis 9:13_

Today we live in the age of the new covenant (Heb. 9:15). God initiated and established this covenant with us. He bears the responsibility, enabling us to carry out His will. Though Noah failed God in his behavior, God still fulfilled His desire through him. Today, God works in us to fulfill His desire, as Paul says:

_For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them._ _ – Ephesians 2:8–10_
