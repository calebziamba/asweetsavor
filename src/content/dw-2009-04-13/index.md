_And having been freed from sin, you were enslaved to righteousness. — Romans 6:18_

_For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness. But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life. — Romans 6:20, 22_

By being born again, we are set free from sin. This means that sin cannot bother us anymore. We should remember this whenever Satan comes to accuse us. Whenever we hear the enemy say, “You claim to be a Christian, but look at what you just did,” all we have to do is reply, “The Lord has set me free from sin. When I was born again, I was set free.”

We should answer any accusations with the word of God. We should not be bothered about so many little things that frustrate us. The Bible tells us that we are free from sin (Rom. 6:18, 20, 22). Formerly we were slaves of sin, but after being born again we are set free.
