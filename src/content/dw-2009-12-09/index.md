_“Go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.” — Ruth 3:3b_

Naomi told Ruth not to make herself known to Boaz until he had finished eating and drinking. This is the experience of those who offer back to the Lord in their consecration what He has worked into them. Some believers publicly announce their consecration in a showy manner even before telling the Lord about it. Real consecration is transacted privately before the Lord and then lived out.
