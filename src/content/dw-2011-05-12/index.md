_So the women sang as they danced, and said:_

_“Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.”_

_Then Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed only thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?” So Saul eyed David from that day forward. — First Samuel 18:7-9_

Watchman Nee wrote a hymn saying that when others stretched out their hands against him and began to struggle with one another, he shut his door and sang hymns to the Lord. He realized that it was the Lord who suffered the most. The Lord takes no joy when Christians fight among themselves over who should submit to whom, and what will happen if they do not.
