"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

_He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets._ _— Matthew 12:19_

When we want to serve the Lord, it is easy to have strife. For example, we often compare ourselves with other brothers: “Who speaks better? Who speaks more often?” We have strife upon strife. However, striving goes directly against the principle of being buried.

If we want to follow the Lord, the first thing is to be a seed. And if we want to be a seed, then the first thing is to be buried. Consider the living of the Lord Jesus. With Him there was no strife and no crying out. There was nothing called “fair,” and there was nothing called “unfair.” On one hand He taught many people, but on the other hand, no one heard His voice in the streets. He helped many people, but with Him there was no “noise”; there was only His sweet presence. Everything He did was in the principle of being hidden.
