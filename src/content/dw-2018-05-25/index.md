_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _â€” Romans 1:1-3_

On the one hand, once we are believers, we are always in Christ and growing in Him. On the other hand, as we grow, we are easily distracted by many things other than Christ, even things that belong to Him and are related to our spiritual lives. Yet shamefully, we do not want Christ Himself.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 8.
