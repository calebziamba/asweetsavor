_“Do not stare at me because I am black,_ _For the sun has burned me.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:6_

When the Shulammite becomes aware of her blackness, she does not want others to look upon her. Often, when the Lord begins to attract us, we seek the attention of others. When someone is zealous for the Lord as a new believer, he often desires to be manifested and appreciated by others. However, those who truly love the Lord and follow the Lord avoid the attention of others, for they are aware of who they are in themselves.
