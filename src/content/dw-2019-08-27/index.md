_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

Our experience will always be along these two lines: the line of nourishing and rest, and the line of the work of the cross. As we experience these two lines, God will be able to constitute us with Himself. We thank the Lord that He does not shame us or reject us for being a wild mare. May the Lord work in us so that we will have more hunger for His nourishing and for His rest. Meanwhile, may we let the cross do its work to make us plaits of gold with studs of silver so that we can live before Him in complete union with Him.
