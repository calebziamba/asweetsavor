_“And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; Depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.’”_ _— Matthew 7:23_

_For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad._ _— Second Corinthians 5:10_

Will the Lord say to us, “I never knew you; depart from Me”? This is a serious matter.I would rather have the Lord defend me than have to defend myself before Him. We should simply follow the Lord and have the peace that He will answer for us.
