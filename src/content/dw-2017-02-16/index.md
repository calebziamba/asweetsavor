_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

The Greek word translated “work out” here is _katergázomai_ (Strong, no. 2716). This word means “to carry out to the goal, to carry to its ultimate conclusion” (Wuest, 2:73). This working out will continue all our life. Day by day, we are in this salvation. We will never grow out of our need for it.
