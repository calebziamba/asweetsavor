_So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And the Lord said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!” Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah. — First Samuel 16:12-13_

_Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will. — Ephesians 1:4-5_

David was chosen and anointed. These are two different things. As believers, we have been chosen from among all the other people before the foundation of the world. Before anything else existed, God chose us and even marked us out for His satisfaction (Eph. 1:4–5). Then we are anointed.
