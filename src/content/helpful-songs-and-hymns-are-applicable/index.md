This message is the fifth hymns session of the January 2009 [Jesus Lovers’ Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/)

To enjoy the Lord in the meetings is not a matter of being excited or of being sober, but of the Spirit. To be strong in spirit, or to be sober, do not conflict; Paul could be either (2 Cor. 5:13). Therefore, we must learn to be in the freedom of the Spirit so that He may have the freedom to lead us in the meetings.

Brother Titus spends a good deal of time to go over one of the young people’s hymns, [“Shine Jesus Shine”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3iB30gCqAc) (Songs & Hymns of Life #341). The hymns that we sing should not just be sensational, but have a good deal of substance, i.e., the truth that is according to our commitment.
