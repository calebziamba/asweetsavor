_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._ _—Philippians 2:8_

The death that the Lord bore was beyond all other experiences of death. The death the Father ordained for Him required Him to die as a criminal in the company of criminals. He died naked, lonely, and forsaken by those closest to Him. Besides all this, God required that He die with the weight of all the sin and sorrow of the human race upon Him (Isa. 53:4–5). He died as One forsaken by God Himself. This was the most extreme experience in which He “humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death of a cross” (Phil. 2:8).
