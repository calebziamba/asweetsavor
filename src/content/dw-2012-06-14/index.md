_See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ. — Colossians 2:8_

Sometimes it is suggested that we should hold various classes in our hall in order to attract people for the gospel’s sake. Perhaps some Chinese language classes could be offered for children, and the Lord could reach some of the parents.

If some are burdened to do this, they should feel free to do so, but we should also take care that no element of the world is brought into the church life by such a practice. Without realizing it, the church could suddenly find itself focused on teaching children instead of on Christ.
