_“Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you.”_ _– Genesis 13:17_

Up to this point, Abraham had only experienced God’s provision in Shechem and Bethel. Now he was to rise up and walk throughout the promised land. This would bring him into a deeper experience and richer enjoyment of God.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 95.
