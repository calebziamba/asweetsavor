> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 2:14-15, KJV

If someone smells me, immediately they say, “I got it, I'm giving my whole life to it!” Some will say, “Oh I can’t take it.” So, some come to life and some go to hell. Am I right? Did he do anything? He didn't. Is he working? No, he isn't. Does he try anything? No, he didn't plan anything, he didn't do anything, he’s only responsible for one thing: that he lived in the presence of God. He’s only responsible for one thing: for God to smell him. When God smelled him, He began to realize, here's a lot of Christ. When Christ comes out from this person, you know what is gonna happen? Some will die, and some will live.
