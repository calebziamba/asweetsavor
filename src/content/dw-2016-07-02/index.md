_The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death._ _– Romans 8:2_

Before we were born again, we lived under the power of death. The prospect of physical death caused us to fear (Heb. 2:15), and the death element within us caused us to live a life according to the prince of this world, Satan. In brief, we had death within and death without. However, in His wonderful death on the cross, Christ destroyed Satan. Moreover, through His resurrection, Christ became the life-giving Spirit, who gave us eternal life the moment we believed. As a result, we now enjoy “the law of the Spirit of life” (Rom. 8:2). We are released from the law of sin and death by being in Christ Jesus.
