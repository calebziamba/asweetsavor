Some brothers insist on a good living. They must have a good car, live in a good house, and listen to the best stereo. They must have a proper living and leisure time.

Living a good life is not a matter of right or wrong. One day, a leading brother complained about a co-worker who was living too well. I responded that if the Lord provides, there is nothing wrong with driving a good car or drinking good tea. There is no need to complain about it if the Lord provides. We shouldnâ€™t have a concept that a full-timer must live a poor life, drive a broken-down car, and live in a shabby house. This is a narrow, religious thought.
