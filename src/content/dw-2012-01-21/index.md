_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the hem of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon That descended upon the mountains of Zion; For there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore. — Psalm 133:1-3_

Verse 3 of this psalm is so sweet and so precious. When the church life enters into maturity the Lord commands His blessing. In His testimony there is life forever more. Just a glimpse of this will make our heart leap for joy!

After reading Psalm 133 we should all pray, “Oh Lord, we don’t want to be emotional about Your testimony. Grant us the reality of oneness under Your divine anointing! We want to exercise with maturity until we have the display of such a marvelous church life!”
