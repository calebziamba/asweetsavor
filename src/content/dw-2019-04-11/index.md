_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

As we follow the Lord, the Song of Songs serves as a wonderful guide. It shows us where we are in our spiritual experience, what experiences we should have, and how we can go on. It can greatly help us to have a strong pursuit of Christ.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 12.
