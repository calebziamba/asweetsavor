_Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. — Song of Songs 4:4, KJV_

Our obedience will bring us the needed bucklers. Sometimes when we have the sense of the Lord’s presence in our prayers, we feel quite victorious; we think that in this way we can defend against the devil. Actually, such an experience only provides a little protection. In reality, the more we obey the Lord, the more bucklers we have.

We should place the emphasis on our obedience rather than on our bucklers. It is through our obedience that we come to possess 1,000 bucklers of mighty men. If this is our experience, we can stand before God as His mighty men.
