_My daughter, shall I not seek some rest for you, that it may be well with you? â€” Ruth 3:1_

As we serve others, we must have these two abilities. On the one hand, we must know the situation of those we serve. What is the next step they need to take? On the other hand, for the sake of their advancement, we must be able to see how the Lord is moving. Then we must act at the proper time.

How is the Lord working? He is winnowing His barley; He is releasing the full power of His resurrection. If we know how to spot this operation of the Lord, and if we recognize the readiness of the ones we are caring for to participate in it, then the resurrected Lord can move richly among us in the church life. All the shells will be cast off, and the reality of resurrection will be powerfully manifested. Naomi saw both Ruth's need and Boaz's move, just as we should see the need of those we are caring for and the Lord's current move.
