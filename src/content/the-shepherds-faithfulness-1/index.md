> Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them

> Luke 2:8-9a

These shepherds are faithful men. This is an uneducated group of people. I don’t know how many of them can read, or even have a thought to read. I believe they are very, very common people. But do you realize, because they are so common they can be very simple. Because they are so simple, they become very faithful.
