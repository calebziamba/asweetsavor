We may be really capable and useful in the hands of the Lord, but we are all typical Jacobs. We have our own ways to gain what God wants us to gain. We have ways to protect ourselves and to manifest ourselves. How we need God’s work and constitution so that we may be molded into His image!

Jacob’s history is very interesting, but if we read it from God’s point of view, we will be surprised how awful he was and his need for the Spirit’s breaking and constitution. We will worship Him, saying “O God, how amazing it is that a fallen man like Jacob, who was not worthy of You, could become Your Israel” (Gen. 32:28).
