_To You I lift up my eyes, O You who are enthroned in the heavens! Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the Lord our God, Until He is gracious to us. — Psalm 123:1-2_

Many times we are not able to receive the Lord's provision. For example, when we are younger the Lord will supply us with the best university, but we may think that we know better than Him. We would say, “That is not the university I desire.” The Lord always knows what is best for us, but we don't always know how to receive it from His hand. Many times the Lord supplies us, but we refuse His supply. Then His hand of supply becomes a hand of support to us.

For instance, when I was younger the Lord provided a good university for me, but I wanted to go somewhere else. The university the Lord provided for me was not prestigious. Eventually I went, but there was bitterness within me. I complained to the Lord that I was not happy. But then there was a support. The Lord was there, and His hand was there. He seemed to be saying, “Look at Me. I am with you. I arranged for you to come here.” At that time I had the full realization that it was of the Lord. I had no desire to leave. The university began to appear very differently to me. It actually became quite beautiful. This was because I continued to look to the Lord, and His hand of supply became a hand of support until I could receive His provision.
