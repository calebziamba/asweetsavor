_But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition._  
_– Philippians 2:19_

For young Christians to be approved, they must learn to become an encouragement to their church leaders. This is one of the hardest lessons to learn because we are so quick to criticize. We have to learn to stand with those who serve us and be their encouragement, whether we agree with them or not. Blessed is the church whose leaders are in a good state of soul!
