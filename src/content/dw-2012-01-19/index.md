_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the edge of his garments. — Psalm 133:1-2_

Eventually the anointing oil ran down from Aaron’s beard to the “hem of his garments.” A person’s garments signifies his outward expression, his testimony. For the ointment to reach the “hem of his garments” means that eventually there is a wonderful testimony produced from our oneness in the church life.

The divine anointing reaches the very hem of our garments. The church life becomes a glorious display. On the one hand it is a display of our maturity, but on the other it is Christ Himself who is expressed. When people look at our oneness they see the marvelous testimony of Christ.
