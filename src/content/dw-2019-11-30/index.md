_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh, who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name’s sake._  
_–_ _Romans_ _1:1-5_

As we experience the unsearchable riches of the gospel, the result will be the spread of the gospel. This spreading of the gospel is related to our exaltation of Christ. Ultimately, every person’s purpose is to exalt and magnify Christ, thus spreading the gospel. We should have a high and noble feeling. A Christian’s life is a life of living and magnifying Christ, a life of the gospel! To everyone who believes in the Lord, loves Him, and serves Him, this is truly the most glorious and valuable life.
