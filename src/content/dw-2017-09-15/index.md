_“I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be blameless.”_ _– Genesis 17:1_

If we are victorious in our Christian life and God asks us to be blameless, we would tell Him proudly, “Hallelujah! Lord, You see how good and blameless we are.” However, if we are weak and God asks us to be blameless, we can only bow down before Him and say, “O Lord, we need Your mercy. We need You to work on us and supply us. Otherwise we cannot be blameless.”
