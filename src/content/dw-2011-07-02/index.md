_I have become all things to all men, so that by all means I may save some. — First Corinthians 9:22b_ Paul identified himself with all in such a way that he might gain all. He did this for the sake of the oneness. To the Jews, he became as a Jew; to those under law, he came as one under law; and to those without law, he was as one without law, although not without law to God. He came as one under the law of Christ. He made an effort to identify himself with all the various saints. To the weak, he became weak. He became all things to all men that he might save some from all backgrounds (1 Cor. 9:19-23). For this cause, he was willing to forfeit his own identity.

To our thought, a mature serving one should behave in a peculiar, “spiritual” way, perhaps lost in holy contemplation. Paul, however, was not like this. When he was with others, he dropped everything but Christ. He was truly a spiritual man. Such a person is able to practice the oneness. May we all take Paul as our pattern for the sake of oneness!
