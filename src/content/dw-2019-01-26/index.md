_So \[Isaac\] built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.  
__– Genesis 26:25_

We all should pray, “Lord, I not only desire an altar to consecrate myself to You, but also a tent. I am willing to live a life of the tent. I don’t know my future. I want You to lead me. I don’t want to be rooted and settled in one place. I want to follow You closely. I will go where You lead. Give me a heart to serve You and Your church wherever You place me.”  
  
When we live a life of the tent, our vision will be broadened, and the Lord will commit more to us. We need God’s mercy so that, like Isaac, we may live a life of the altar and the tent.
