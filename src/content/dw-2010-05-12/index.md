_Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. — John 17:17_

What does it mean to say the word changes your being? It sanctifies you. It causes your taste to change. You even have a different fragrance. Your likes and dislikes change. What you were previously occupied with no longer seems to matter, because the word has caused you to adhere to something quite different.

This is the power of the word. Who can memorize four of Paul’s epistles? Start with four of his shorter books: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. Take notes, and saturate yourself with these books, and your person will be different. You will become sanctified. You will learn to be in spirit through the word. This exercise will lead you into all reality.
