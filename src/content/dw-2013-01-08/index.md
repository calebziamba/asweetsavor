_“How beautiful you are, my darling,_ _How beautiful you are!_ _Your eyes are like doves behind your veil;_ _Your hair is like a flock of goats_ _That have descended from Mount Gilead.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:1_

When you pay the price before the Lord, there will be a beautiful, sevenfold result, as seen in Song of Songs 4:1-5. We should desire this experience, for whoever has these seven items is healthy before the Lord. Such ones are worthy to be His bride. When we have reached this stage, the Lord is blessed in us and glorified through us.
