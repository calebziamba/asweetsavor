_“The Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys.”_ _– Genesis 24:35_

The servant told Rebekah’s family about Abraham and his riches. In figure, Abraham was like God who has all the riches in heaven and on earth. All the riches are in the house of our Father. Whenever the Holy Spirit testifies, He shows us God’s riches. How rich, precious, and glorious is our God! The Spirit shows us that our God is unsearchably rich (Eph. 3:8).
