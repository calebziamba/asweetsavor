_“My mother’s sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept.” —Song of Songs 1:6_

When you have an intimate relationship with the Lord and the Lord shines upon you, you will find that you become burdened for the vineyard. At that point, the Lord looks upon you and makes you realize that you are black, and other brothers and sisters will look at you and think that you are not willing to cooperate or that you yourself don’t know where to function.

If you did not have a special relationship with the Lord, you would have no controversy with these saints, and they would not notice you much. However, once you have a special relationship with the Lord, you find that you have no rest. When the seeker says, “My own vineyard I have not kept,” she indicates that in such a situation, she just doesn’t know how to carry out what the Lord has committed to her.
