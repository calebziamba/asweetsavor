_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

The most difficult aspect of the world for us to deal with as believers is the religious aspect. The religious world plays to “the lust of the eyes” (1 John 2:16). The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was “a delight to the eyes” (Gen. 3:6). It was because of its attractiveness that man fell under its spell.
