In the church life, we need to remember that we should never try to keep a person by placing him into service. Although it is possible to keep a person in the church life by bringing him to serve in some area, this is not the best way to help him. In particular, if you seek to establish someone in the church life by giving him some kind of responsibility before he has really touched the Lord, you are actually placing a stumbling block in front of him.

When we are seeking to help people, we need to bring them to the Lordâ€™s presence, so that they can have a direct relationship with the Lord, rather than just to an outward work. We need to help people live before the Lord, for what matters is not our work but our relationship with the Lord. Although work can satisfy a certain need for a while, nothing can replace the Lord Himself.
