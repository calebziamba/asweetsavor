_“Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.” — Joshua 1:3_ We may read these verses as, “Every place that my eyes observe or that I think about, the Lord has given me.” No! The Lord says, “Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you” (Josh. 1:3).

Why do our feet have to do the work? Why can’t we let our eyes or mind do it? It is because only when we walk in Christ (Col. 2:6) do we realize He is so marvelous, rich, faithful, and exalted.
