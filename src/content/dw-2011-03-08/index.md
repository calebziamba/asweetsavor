_"The king has brought me into his chambers." — Song of Songs 1:4b_

_“Our couch is green.” — Song of Songs 1:16b_

_“Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste." — Song of Songs 2:3_ If you remain in the experience of the king’s chambers, your experience will be confined. As you progress, however, you will experience rest in life and the supply of life in your situations.

Eventually, this life will overshadow you, and you will remain under its shade. Life will be under you, and it will be above you, and you will live in the realm of Christ’s abundant and transcendent life.
