_“I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”_ _– John 8:12_

When we enjoy Christ as the Light of life, we are no longer in darkness. We know how to walk properly, and we realize what is right and what is wrong. Christ as the Light of life shines within us for our daily walk.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 89.
