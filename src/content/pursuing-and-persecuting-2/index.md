> Not that I have already obtained the prize , or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession of it , seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus .

> \- Philippians 3:12

I’m afraid that our pursuing comes short of this. We just study the Bible a little, pray a little, and then go do whatever we feel is best. We need to be more aggressive in our pursuit, even to the point of becoming a persecutor of Christ. I’m a persecutor of my Bible, especially Philippians. That is why my Bible is falling to pieces. That is persecution. I give my Bible no peace. Can we pay such a high price in our pursuit of the Lord?
