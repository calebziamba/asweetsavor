> Sustain me with raisin cakes,  
> Refresh me with apples,  
> Because I am lovesick.
> 
> \- Song of Songs 2:5

The church cannot go on without those who have the “raisin cakes.” The more experienced saints there are in the church, the more capacity every brother and sister will develop to enjoy the Lord. Praise the Lord! He can help us and work on us through all those who have gone before us.
