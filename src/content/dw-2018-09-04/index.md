_But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition. For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare. For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus. But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father._ _—Philippians 2:19–22_

The Greek word for “proven worth” here means “approvedness, tried character.” If, after being tried, we are found approved by both God and the believers, we can become a source of blessing to the churches, for God only entrusts His work to those who are approved.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 137.
