We need to have a heart that is purely for the Lord. Like Paul, we should “count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord” (Phil. 3:8). If we want to gain the world as well as the Lord, serve with our own goals as well as the Lord’s, and supply others with things from ourselves in addition to things from the Lord, eventually we will discover we are not walking the way of God.
