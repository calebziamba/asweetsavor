_Your lips are like a scarlet thread, And your mouth is lovely. Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranate Behind your veil. — Song of Songs 4:3_

_Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person._ _— Colossians 4:6_

In the church life, all our coordination comes in the form of words. If your words are not through redemption, you can’t coordinate sweetly with others. If we come together and our words turn to gossip, it is not possible to have any genuine coordination. Only when we have a proper speaking can the church be built up.
