_“I am the rose of Sharon,  
 The lily of the valleys.”  
– Song of Songs 2:1  
_

If we let this verse become a reality in us, we will never be a problem to the church, nor will we encounter any problem in the church. Instead, we will be able to function properly in all kinds of situations. We will only say, “Lord, thank You for Your leading. We are just lilies under Your care. Men don’t take care of us, nor does a work care for us. It is You Yourself who takes care of each one of us. Even if we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we will fear no evil, for You are with us.”

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 73.
