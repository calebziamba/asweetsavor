_“I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.’” — Song of Songs 5:2_

Brothers and sisters, we would never even dream that the Lord would ask this of us. We do not know that the Lord is in such a state. There is nothing on the earth, however, that can really satisfy Him. God’s purpose has not yet been fulfilled. Nevertheless, we are so satisfied when we call on His name and touch Him in spirit. We are so satisfied when we enjoy the Lord. It is so easy for us to shout, “Hallelujah!” We don’t realize that the Lord is still a wanderer, that His head is full of dew and His locks with the drops of night. We don’t know that He is still waiting for the appearance of the morning.
