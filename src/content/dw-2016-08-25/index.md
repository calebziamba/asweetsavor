I really have sympathy for brothers in a church life where the atmosphere has been corrupted. They love the Lord, they are faithful, and they serve in the church, but the Lord can never use them. They have the divine nature, but their growing environment is too limited. The conversations of these saints are low, and their relationships are low. Their fear and godliness have been stripped away in such an atmosphere. In their church life the reality of spirituality cannot be manifested, not to mention the growth of a good personality. No matter how prudent or capable they are, the Lord can never use them.
