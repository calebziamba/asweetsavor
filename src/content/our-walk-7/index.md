> Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk \[Gr. _peripateō_\] according to the pattern you have in us.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:17 NASB

Our Christian living should be a walk (_peripateō_) in the realm of resurrection, that we may reign in life until we are conformed to the image of Christ. Paul described this walk in Romans: “As Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life” (Rom. 6:4). We should all be free to follow the Lord of life as He desires.
