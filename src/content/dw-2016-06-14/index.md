_Among \[the unbelievers we\] all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ._ _– Ephesians 2:3–5_

In these verses we see that, whereas before we lived a fleshly life and were under God’s condemnation, we are now in a position of life.

John 5:24 also tells us that we are now in life:

_Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life._

Thank the Lord, we have “passed out of death into life!”
