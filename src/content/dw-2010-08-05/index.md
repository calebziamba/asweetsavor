Just as our natural man is of three sections— our mind, our emotion, and our will—so the world is also of three sections: the sinful section, the material or physical section, and the religious section. The sinful world appeals to our fallen flesh, while the material world appeals to our natural man when we are not focused on Christ alone. Many, for instance, pursue a certain job with a certain company in order to have a certain type of comfortable life.

The sinful world, as pictured in Ruth, was dealt with in chapter one when Ruth told Naomi, “Wherever you go, I will go…and your God \[shall be\] my God.” (1:16). The material world was dealt with in chapter three, when Ruth wholly offered herself to Boaz at the threshing floor.

Because we have been redeemed by Christ, in principle our natural man will no longer choose the sinful aspects of the world. Nor, in principle, will our natural man desire the material aspect of the world if we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord. What aspect of the world remains for us? This may come as a surprise: It is the religious world that has the ability to prevent us from enjoying total union with Christ.
