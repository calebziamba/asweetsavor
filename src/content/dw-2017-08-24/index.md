_It came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. – Genesis 15:17 (ASV)_

Our experience is the same as David’s, who also went through high points and low points. Sometimes things go smoothly. Our spirit soars, and we sing, “Hallelujah!” At other times we are in hardships and difficulties and cannot rest peacefully at night. These are the experiences of the torch and furnace. We can never get away from them.
