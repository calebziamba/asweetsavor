> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
> 
> – Philippians 4:6 (NASB)

I would also suggest that we read a few verses from the Bible out loud as we begin to pray. This also will quiet our soul and make it easier to pray. Singing a spiritual song to the Lord can also help in this way, particularly if we sing some portion over and over. For instance, we can sing:

_Each day let Thy supporting might  
My weakness still embrace;  
My darkness vanish in Thy light,  
Thy life my death efface. (Martin, no. 220)_

Then we can pray, “O Lord, each day I worship You for Your supporting might.” A few verses or lines from a hymn can bring us into a quieted state before the Lord.
