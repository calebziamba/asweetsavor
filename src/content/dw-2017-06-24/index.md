_You are My friends if you do what I command you._ _– John 15:14_

We can open up everything to the Lord Jesus as our Friend. I encourage you to really practice this. When you are home and have some time, try to open yourself to Him, even if it is just for a few minutes. Tell Him everything. Tell Him even about all the things that you think are too shameful, too low, or too insignificant to speak of. You may feel that there are some things you cannot tell Him, but that is not true. The more you are aware of such things, the more you should let Him know all about them.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 77.
