It does not seem that the conclusion of the Jerusalem conference had any effect on those causing the trouble. Men from James (Gal. 2:12), the very James who settled the issue of circumcision at the conference in Jerusalem, still went from church to church to undo Paul’s work of the gospel, insisting that Gentile believers be circumcised. Even though the decision seems to have been somewhat of a failure, Paul still continued to seek fellowship with James and those in Jerusalem (Acts 21:17–18). Regardless of whether or not decisions made during fellowship are honored, fellowship is still to be valued, for it brings in a relatedness through the divine life we all share.
