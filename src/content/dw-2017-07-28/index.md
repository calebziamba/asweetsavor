_“I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”_ _– Genesis. 15:1, NKJV._

Both the shield and the reward are, in reality, God Himself. The reward is inward and the shield is outward. The outward shield blocks all the flaming arrows of Satan. The inward reward increases as we gain more of God’s riches within us. This renders us more growth in life and becomes our eternal life supply. Some Christians are quite mature in the Lord. No matter how Satan attacks them, how people trouble them, or how hard their environment is, they stand firm and are not touched. The schemes and flaming arrows of the devil cannot touch them (Eph. 6:11, 16). People’s thoughts and words cannot affect them, either. Their inward reward is great, and their life supply is abundant. However, even with such believers, there is still the danger of becoming self-confident and proud. This annuls the shield, and opens the door to the enemy’s attack.
