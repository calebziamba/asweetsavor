_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

The Philippians seemed to be doing very well spiritually. They loved the apostle Paul and strove together alongside him in the gospel. In what matters did they need to experience salvation? Since they were such spiritually successful believers, seeking to distinguish themselves in the Lord’s service, they were in danger of falling into the religious world.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; page 121.
