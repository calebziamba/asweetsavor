_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren._ _– Romans 8:29_

The fourth key item regarding the content of Romans is that it reveals to us God’s will, His economy, and His marvelous work in us.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 11.
