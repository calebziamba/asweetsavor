_If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin. — 1 John 1:7_

_And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him. — 1 John 2:27_ There is no feeding apart from the anointing, for feeding comes through the anointing. If we are not with the Lord, that is, if we do not have the sense that He is living, that He is dear, and that He is with us, then we should realize that we do not have His anointing. In such a situation we cannot receive the proper nourishment from Him.

When we experience the anointing, we are also fed by the Lord. To be fed by Him is to partake of the Lord Himself, and thus the Lord Himself becomes our satisfaction. The divine anointing brings the Triune God Himself to us.

We receive this nourishment in the process of fellowshipping with the Lord, and as we are nourished through Him, we are brought under His enlightenment. The sweeter our fellowship with Him, the more we come to know ourselves, for our attitudes, motives, manner of life, and relationship with the Lord are all brought under the Lord's shining. In this fellowship, the Lord is able to enlighten every aspect of our lives.
