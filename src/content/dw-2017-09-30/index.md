_Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb._ _– Romans 4:19_

The church needs those who have this kind of life. Not many have come to the point that the work of God in them has caused them to know themselves. We need to know ourselves to the extent that we can only laugh, saying, “O God, I cannot leave You. Although Your calling seems too high for me, Your promise seems impossible with me, and Your leading unattainable to me, I dare not say that I cannot. If You don’t want Ishmael, I have no way. I know who I am, and I know who You are. Although I cannot believe, I trust You to accomplish everything through me.” Although we may find it hard to believe what God says, yet we cannot forsake His calling. If this is our experience, we will be useful to the Lord.
