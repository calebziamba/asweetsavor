_It is vain for you to rise up early, To lie down late, To eat the bread of toil; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep. Behold, children are a gift of Jehovah, The fruit of the womb is a reward. — Psalm 127:2-3_

Why does the Bible use these words? When we trust in the Lord's government, when we learn to have no choice for ourselves but allow Him to put us to sleep, then the Lord causes our “womb” to bear children. In other words, we have an inner growth and transformation which enables us to be fruitful. We produce children as “arrows,” which implies something of strength.

Not only do we have an outward fruitfulness, but inwardly we are prepared, facilitated, and equipped with riches. We no longer have an immature desire to do many things for the Lord. Instead, we become someone equipped by the Lord with inward strength and riches. That is why our children are likened to arrows. When we are put to sleep we experience growth and transformation. Eventually this process not only enables us to be fruitful, but also makes us strong and mature. We are like a “mighty man” with “arrows.” Because we have grown and matured inwardly, we are equipped with the riches to effectively serve the Lord.
