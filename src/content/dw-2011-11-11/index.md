_But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, they worked craftily, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and mended...._

_Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they did not ask counsel of the Lord. — Joshua 9:3.14_

Though we may be cheated by man, God can use our mistakes to gain a victory. Joshua failed by not seeking God before making a covenant with the Gibeonites. This covenant forced him to come to Gibeon’s defense when it was attacked by five kings of the Amorites (Josh. 10:1–7). In turn, the Lord used this as an opportunity to perform one of the greatest miracles in the Bible—He prolonged the day so Joshua could win the victory (vv. 12–13).

We may make mistakes, but if we are for the Lord, He can use our wrong decisions for His glory. This was the experience of Joshua. His heart was for the Lord and His plan and for His people. Thus, even when he did fail, God used it to glorify Himself through a miraculous victory over the five Amorite kings.
