God spoke to Noah, and this living word controlled him. We cannot serve the Lord with our whole heart simply by declaring our intent to do so. This won’t work! We need God’s living word to control, direct, and supply our life. Though we may be touched by the Lord even to the point of tears, this does not mean we have necessarily received God’s living, controlling, and supplying word.
