_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

As we follow the Lord, people may be hard on us or misunderstand us. We may have a lot of difficulties, but these cannot prevent us from following Christ. The Holy Spirit testifies to us of Christ until we are ready to drop everything for Him, saying, “I want to follow You. Let no one stop me!” How wonderful is the work of the Holy Spirit! He keeps testifying of the Lord and draws us to run after Him!
