_For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare._  
_– Philippians 2:20_

We must show love in our church. We must labor in humility and simplicity. As we serve those in our own church diligently, we will gain their appreciation. Without this appreciation there is no approvedness.
