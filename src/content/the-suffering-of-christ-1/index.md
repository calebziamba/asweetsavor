> _Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._
> 
> \- Philippians 2:5-7

Christ, being in the form of God, gave up His rights in becoming a man and emptying Himself (Phil. 2:6–7). He did not count His preexistence in the heavenly places as an inalienable right. He did not even insist upon a comfortable human life. He was born in a stable, a place of strong smells and noise. Instead of growing up in a palace, He grew up in a carpenter’s home. What caused Him to go through all this? He gave up all for our sakes. “He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich” (2 Cor. 8:9).
