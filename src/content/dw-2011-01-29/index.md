_Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus, that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. â€” Romans 15:5-6_ Remember, we were sinners, then we were reconciled, and now we are being saved in His life, we reign in life, we walk in the newness of life, and we are being sanctified by the work of the Spirit. Eventually we are being renewed, we have the Spirit of life, and we walk according to spirit. This produces the one accord. Do we realize that the one accord is not a thing to do together, but our growing up together? When we grow up together, the reality of one accord is ours.
