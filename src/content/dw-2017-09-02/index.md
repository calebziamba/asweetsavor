_Then behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.”_ _– Genesis 15:4_

Abraham’s three possible heirs, Eliezer, Ishmael, and Isaac, represent the process of gaining God. Eliezer represents living by our natural concept, Ishmael represents trying to fulfill God’s desire by our own fleshly strength, and Isaac signifies being born of the Spirit.
