_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

The consolation that Paul was seeking in 2:1 is “consolation of love.” The Greek word for “love” here is _agape_. The verb form of this word means “to love out of an intelligent estimate of the object of love”; it “contemplates the attributes and character” of what is loved (Vincent, 4:167). In other words, it is a love that treasures its object.
