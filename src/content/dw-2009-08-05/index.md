_Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint — Proverbs 29:18_ Without vision, our life has no direction, and we do not know what to do with our life. Vision regulates our life. If we desire to have direction in our life, we must have a vision.

Where does vision come from? It comes by means of revelation. It does not come from just one revelation, but from revelation upon revelation until something is constituted into us to become a vision.
