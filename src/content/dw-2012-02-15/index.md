_"Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards, While our vineyards are in blossom." — Song of Songs 2:15_

The seeker’s heart is not pure at this time. The Lord seems to be telling her, ”You should want nothing but Me. You should walk the way of the cross with Me and experience all My sufferings and all My riches in resurrection.”

Alas! How poor and shallow we are. How easy it is for us to miss Him. While the Lord is calling, we reply, “Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes, that ruin the vineyards while our vineyards are in blossom.” The seeker of the Lord is still concerned about her work, and she forgets the Lord’s desire that she continue to go higher. Instead, she worries about what to do with the vineyards. She forgets the Lord’s calling. As long as she is still trapped in the work and satisfied by a little achievement and progress, she will be unable to experience the riches of Christ’s ascension and the glory of His resurrection.
