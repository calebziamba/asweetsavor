_God also told Noah, “You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female.”_ _– Genesis 7:2_

Although this also may have seemed overwhelming to Noah, he didn’t ask whether it was possible. If we have the living word of God, we can do anything He commands, no matter how peculiar it seems.
