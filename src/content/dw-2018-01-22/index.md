_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

It is surprising that Rebekah followed the servant immediately with no further consideration. We would expect her to ask, “What does Isaac look like? How old is he?” When we touch the Lord, we shouldn’t consider whether He is worthy of our following Him. Once we are attracted to Him, all the considerations are gone.
