What prompts our mourning? It is our seeing of the situation around us. Each class of human beings, each race, each nationality is rejecting Christ. We should mourn for those people who are rejecting the Lord Jesus. We should be full of feeling. “Eight million in Chicago rejecting Christ! Lord, have mercy!” \[The church\] should have the experience of mourning over the situation in their city.
