Suppose a brother comes among you and boasts of his service and exercises some kind of seniority. He may mention all the past trainings and conferences he participated in over the past years. Upon hearing of all his past experiences, you may respect and honor him. But if you have some growth in life, you may also realize that, while he is a good brother, he lacks life and the Spirit. Therefore, in time your growth in life will reject what this brother presents himself as being. You will not reject him as a brother, but you will reject his function, for in the church life, everything must be exclusively of the Spirit.
