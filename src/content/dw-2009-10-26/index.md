_God has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. — Second Corinthians 3:6_

_Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart.... — Second Corinthians 4:1_ In the Bible there are the words “ministers” and “ministry.” “Ministry” refers to a portion, and “ministers” refers to the persons. Ministry is something constituted or apportioned by the Lord; a minister is the person who carries out the ministry apportioned to him. In the churches there should be many ministers who are fulfilling their ministries before the Lord.
