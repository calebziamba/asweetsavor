_Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob - Genesis 25:26_

Before we are transformed, God cannot even prevail against us. In Peniel Jacob wrestled with God the whole night. Even after God touched the socket of his thigh, making him limp, Jacob still said, “I will not let You go unless You bless me” (32:26). He forgot his father had given him God’s blessing (28:3–4). He forgot God had already blessed him at Bethel (vv. 13–15). He only knew he couldn’t let go of this opportunity to be blessed. He wouldn’t let go of God until God blessed him by changing his name to Israel. This was Jacob.
