_“I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.”_ _– Revelation 3:15–16_

The Lord wants us to be in one extreme or another—cold or hot. If we are hot, we are full of feeling, zealous for the Lord, loving and pursuing Him. If we are cold, we are also full of feeling, realizing our need to come back to the Lord. However, if we are lukewarm, we are religious and make no trouble, but experience no growth. This is offensive to the Lord. We need the experience of both the torch and the furnace for the Lord to deal with us and mold us into useful vessels. Through this process, we also begin to know who God really is.
