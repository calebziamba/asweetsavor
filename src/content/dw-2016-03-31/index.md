_But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh...._ _ If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit._ _– Galatians 5:16, 25_

Walking with God in spirit is the foundation (Gal. 5:16, 25). Without this foundation we cannot receive God’s word. However, even with this foundation, if we do not have the living word, we cannot come to the full knowledge.

For example, we might pray, “Lord, I am nothing and You are everything,” but do we really consider ourselves nothing? Only the living word of God can show us who we truly are. When the light comes, we confess, “Lord, I didn’t know who I really was. I didn’t realize how poorly I served You. Now I know how bad I am.”

One time Watchman Nee was accused of something, and his sister-in-law told him about it. He answered, “I am much worse than their accusation.” He didn’t argue or fight. He wasn’t upset or angry. We need to pray, “Lord, I need Your living word for my every step.” God’s living word is the way to carry out His will.
