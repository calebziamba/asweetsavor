_Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, That I live among the tents of Kedar! Too long have I lived Among those who hate peace._ _I am for peace, but when I speak, They are for war. — Psalm 120:5-7_

_Demas has abandoned me, having loved the present age..._. _— 2 Timothy 4:10_

Many who have been among us once loved the Lord but eventually went back to the world. This doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't enjoy the church life. They may have enjoyed the church life, but they didn't have a vision concerning the world. In other words, they didn't see through the world. They didn't realize its true nature. The world can become very tempting and attractive to those who love the Lord. This is why we must have a clear vision concerning the world.
