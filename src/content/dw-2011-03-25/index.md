_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So _is_ my beloved among the sons. I sat down in his shade with great delight, And his fruit _was_ sweet to my taste." _— Song of Songs 2:3__

_“Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, For I am sick with love.” — Song of Songs 2:5_ Her statement, “Refresh me with apples,” indicates that we need the Christ in the brothers and sisters. Our attitude towards the saints should be, “Please give me your Christ so that I can be enlarged. I need you as well as the Lord. Now my soul fails. I don’t know what to do. It seems that morning watch cannot help me, and my own prayer cannot sustain me. Even the weekly meetings cannot supply me enough. I need more. Oh, Lord, I am sick with love. Brothers and sisters, please help me to love the Lord. Oh, Lord, draw me more to love You. I don’t know how to love You. I want to give You more.”

At this time, the seeking one seems despondent before the Lord. Although she depends upon the Lord, she also needs more help from the brothers and sisters.
