> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, all who are mature, let’s have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that to you as well; however, let’s keep living \[Gr. __stoicheō__\] by that same _standard_ to which we have attained.

> \-- Philippians 3:14-16 NASB

For our basic walk (stoicheō), we need not all conform to the same outward practices, but we must all walk with the sole aim of gaining Christ and maturing in Him. When we all have such a heart, we spontaneously have the stoicheō walk. Our attitude toward other Christians is then, “I don’t care if your practices are the same as mine as long as we are able to go on together gaining Christ.”
