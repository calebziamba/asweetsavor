_So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. — Ephesians 2:19_

When we were born again we were born into God's household. Some versions of the Bible translate the word “household” as “family.” We have become members of the family of God. Once again, we should realize that we can no longer be by ourselves. We should not think, “I'll just take care of my own spiritual condition.” God wants us to be with the other members of His family.

We saw earlier that we were born again not only to be individual vessels, but also to be God's temple, which is His testimony, and to be members of the Body of Christ. Now we also see that we were born again to be fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. How, then, can we choose to be isolated? How can we decide to remain by ourselves? How can we pursue an individualistic Christian life? We must realize that our Christian life is a corporate matter. Our new position makes us members of the household of God. The household of God is corporate, like a family, and we are positioned to live a corporate Christian life.
