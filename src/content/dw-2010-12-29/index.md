_“I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.” — Song of Songs 2:1_

Every young saved one feels he is most hopeful and expects to be someone special. Every saint hopes he will have a certain manifestation in the church life. No one is willing to be ordinary.

If the brother who helped you to love the Lord told you, “You will be hopeless,” it is doubtful you would still have any desire to pursue the Lord. If you were to think, “Why should I pay the  price to love the Lord since I will be hopeless?” that would mean your focus is on yourself instead of the Lord.

Thinking in this way indicates that you are living in a religious world. Once you realize that you are a rose of Sharon, you will know that you are not special in the church life. Among those who follow the Lord, you will become an unassuming person.
