_Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn ewes Which have come up from their washing, All of which bear twins, And not one among them has lost her young. — Song of Songs 4:2_

We shouldn’t be selective in receiving life and truth.  If we are selective, our teeth are not like a flock of shorn ewes. Instead of coming up clean from the washing, we bring something impure into our spiritual pursuit.

The maiden here can now receive and gain help from the Lord in every situation. She is not selective. Her flesh has been taken out of the way, and she is able to receive feeding from whatever means the Lord chooses. Moreover, her ability of chewing and receiving is uniform, as indicated by the phrase “all of which have borne twins, and none of them is bereaved of her young.” She has such a good receiving and chewing ability.
