Considering how to make money is not evil, but it is usually not spiritual, for the Lord is not typically interested in that. We must learn to be one with the Lord and make our decisions in a spiritual way.

No more should you think in terms of whether or not something is possible or profitable, or whether or not something is right or wrong; from now on you must consider simply whether or not something is of the Spirit.
