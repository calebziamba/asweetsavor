_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

This father-child relationship is very crucial to the growth of every young Christian. It is extremely sweet because it is a relationship of life and love. A true father would even lay down his life for his child. Whoever has this kind of father is very blessed.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 160.
