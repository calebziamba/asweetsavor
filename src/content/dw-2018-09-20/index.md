In twenty or thirty years, how many will be sufficiently equipped? If none are pursuing the truth today, the Lord’s work tomorrow will be limited. Who will be able to minister the truth? Will there be anyone with an abundance of riches to feed the Lord’s children?

We must know the divine revelation found in the Word, and we must know the riches given to us through the Lord’s servants who have gone before.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 140.
