_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

I have seen many who have held fast to something in the church in order to become successful, but they have not become spiritual. How can we come out of such impulsive grasping at things? It is by laying hold of Christ. He provides us with another mind. We must spend time to allow Him to work His mind, His person, into us.
