_“For why should I be like one who veils herself_ _Beside the flocks of your companions?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

Brothers and sisters, if you do not have a relationship with the Lord, you will never experience this. You will simply be a daughter of Jerusalem in the church life, going to meetings just like a sheep in someone else’s flock. Once you develop a relationship with the Lord, however, you will see the Lord’s “companions,” His co-workers. They all have their flocks which they have taken good care of. But how do you feel? If they ask you to be a sheep in one of their flocks, you feel you can’t, for you belong only to the Lord. Yet, you also realize that you are not able to take care of anything on your own. Eventually, all that is left for you to do is to wander alongside the flocks of the companions.
