_A Psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who drove him away and he departed...._

_I sought the Lord, and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears. They looked to Him and were radiant, And their faces will never be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him And saved him out of all his troubles. — Psalm 34:4-6_

David was saying, “Nothing and no one but God is worthy of my trust. I tried other means, but none satisfied. I have tasted and seen that the Lord is good. Only the Lord is able to be my salvation. Now my rest is in Him alone.”

Adapted from _[David: After God's Heart,](/book-david "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 65-66.
