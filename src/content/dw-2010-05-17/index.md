_“Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock, Where do you make it lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?”_

_“If you yourself do not know, Most beautiful among women, Go forth in the footsteps of the flock And pasture your young goats By the shepherds’ tents.” — Song of Songs 1:7-8_ It is wrong to think that today we are the end-all of the Lord’s recovery and that what the saints did before is of little importance. We may be laboring at a different stage in the Lord’s work, but the principles of life have not changed. To follow the Lord, we need to be able to learn from the life experiences of those who are ahead of us and who have gone ahead of us.

Unless we are unfaithful, we will end up confronting what other saints have confronted before. Thus, we have to receive what others have learned. The Lord wants to save us from work into life. As He has shepherded his lovers in the past, in the same manner He will shepherd us.
