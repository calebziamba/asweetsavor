By the time we reach the fifth stage of the Psalms of Ascent (Ps. 132-134) we have learned to tell the Lord, “I dare not do anything, nor can I do anything. Lord, all of my past spiritual ambitions, and all of my desires to be used by You in a great way, are gone now. I realize that I am nothing. I just want to be a child in Your presence.” This is the result of our healthy growth in life.
