In addition to enjoying Christ as our bread of life and water of life, we also need to enjoy Him as the Light of life. In John 8:12 Jesus says,

_I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 89.
