_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

This picture of Paul and the Philippians running, toiling, serving, sacrificing, and being poured out as a drink offering is a rich expression of grace being lived out in the body life. When we see this picture, we realize that no one could ever manufacture such a thing. Only grace could accomplish this.
