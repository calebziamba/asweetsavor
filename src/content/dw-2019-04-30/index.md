_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

Brothers and sisters, we should let Christ be our total satisfaction throughout our Christian life. Our situation may change, the stages of our human life may advance, and the way we serve and work may vary. However, we have to remember that the Lord is always the center and reality of everything.  
  
When we follow the Lord and give everything to Him, He gives us nothing but Himself. Even at the end, we will receive nothing from the Lord but Himself. In the beginning, He was everything to us, and in the end, He will still be everything to us. Life without Him is completely meaningless.
