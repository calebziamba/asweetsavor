_So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father's household heard of it, they went down there to him. Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him. — First Samuel 22:1-2_ David was able to escape the situation in Gath because of his feigned madness. Realizing that there was no one left to protect him, he took refuge in the cave of Adullam (1 Sam. 22:1). Like David, we believers all pass through various experiences until we finally discover that only God is our true refuge.

While David was in this cave, his father’s household came to him (v. 1). All his brothers came to stand with him. This must have been a real comfort to David. Also, all those who were distressed, in debt, and discontented came to him and took him as their captain (v. 2). In other words, the homeless and unwanted came to David. None of the thousands of troops he commanded came to him nor any of those women who sang his praises. Instead, those who came were the psychologically distressed, those unable to hold down a job, and those who could find no satisfaction in their current situation.
