_“Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham.”_  
_– Genesis 26:18_

We must be diligent and dig every day. We don’t know when our well will be stopped. The world we live in is full of mud which can easily stop up our well. To be rid of the mud once and for all, we would have to leave the world. Since we can’t do that, the mud will keep on coming. The secret to keeping the living water flowing is to dig out the mud all the time. When the flow of life within is blocked, we have to go back to our spirit and to the Word to pray, to fellowship, and to call upon the name of the Lord in order to deal with our flesh, our natural life, and the world.
