_God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness. — John 4:24

That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. — John 3:6_

How do we enter into the enjoyment of Christ, which is in the Spirit of reality? In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said something quite interesting. He said, “Do you know who God is? God is Spirit.” God is not in the physical realm. Neither is God in the theoretical realm. God is not a material, nor is He a theory. Then who, or what, is God? According to the Lord Jesus, God is Spirit! Then the Lord said, “Do you want to worship God? If you want to worship God, you need to worship Him in spirit.”

First, God is Spirit. Second, we are God-created human beings, who also have a spirit. It is in our human spirit that we were born again. John 3:6 tells us, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” We were born again in spirit, and now we must worship God in spirit. No matter how excellent our minds are, no matter how high our IQs are, we can never find God with our minds. Why? Because God is not a theory. God is not found in the mind. When Jesus was on the earth, He told us this. He said, “Do you want to know God? God is Spirit. Do you want to worship God? Then you must use your human spirit.”
