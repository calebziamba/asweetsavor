_Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ. — First Corinthians 11:1_

One time in Cleveland a brother not yet in the recovery asked brother Lee about a certain verse. I did not even know where it was located. It seemed that brother was purposely testing Brother Lee. But Brother Lee simply opened his Bible and told the brother, “This is the verse you are talking about.”

We should learn to equip ourselves as Brother Lee has. We may not match him in equipping, but at least we must practice in the manner he has exercised himself. He reads the Bible morning to evening; he immerses himself in it. He has been filling his Bible with notes for years. One brother said that as Brother Lee worked with him on a book, he paid much attention to the notes he had written within his Bible. Now that he is in his eighties, he still writes notes in his Bible. We should learn from him and practice the same.
