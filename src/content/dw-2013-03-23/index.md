_“Now behold, with great pains I have prepared for the house of the Lord 100,000 talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for they are in great quantity; also timber and stone I have prepared, and you may add to them.” – First Chronicles 22:14_

_Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man’s work._ _– First Corinthians 3:12-13_

The more we experience the ruling of God (iron) and the judgment of God (brass), the more we realize our need of salvation through Christ’s redemption (silver) and God’s divine nature (gold).We begin to realize that we need salvation in our thoughts, in our decisions, in our emotions, and in our actions—including our way of eating and manner of dress. Eventually, the Lord’s salvation must reach every area of our lives.
