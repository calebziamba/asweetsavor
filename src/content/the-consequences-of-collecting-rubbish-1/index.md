> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8

Some antique collectors fill their houses with so much antique furniture they have very little living space. We may collect spiritual things like this, not realizing how much they occupy us, even to the point that Christ is pushed out. Paul, however, determined never to let such a thing happen. This is why he not only counted all things loss but even counted all things as rubbish.

Some rubbish only occupies; some both occupies and contaminates. I have to be careful or else preoccupation with my furniture will contaminate my heart and affect my spiritual health. Because of this, I must learn to simply reckon such things as loss and count them as rubbish.
