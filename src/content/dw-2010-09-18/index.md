None of the judges seemed to exhibit any interest in what was really on God’s heart. They were raised up to judge God’s people, but none of them asked God how they should judge or what would truly please Him. They should have asked Him, “How should I be with Your people? How can I represent You if I do not know what is in Your heart? Reveal Your heart to me.”
