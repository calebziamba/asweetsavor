> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:14 ESV

We have both a destination and a direction, and the goal before us is always moving onward yet always remaining within our sight. This goal we run toward is Christ, and it is overseen by Christ.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 220
