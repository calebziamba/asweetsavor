_The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran._ _– Genesis 11:32_

While Abraham was in Haran, he had his first experience of God’s discipline through the death of his father (Gen. 11:32). Abraham’s father represented the origin of his natural existence and the source by which he lived his natural life. When his father died, this strength he relied on disappeared. Only then was he able to rise up and began to walk.
