_"Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards, While our vineyards are in blossom." — Song of Songs 2:15_ The Lord has called His seeker to escape from her feelings, her experiences, her past assurances, and whatever else had become important to her. The Lord has called her to walk the way of the cross in union with Him so that she might enter into the experience of resurrection. As a result, the Lord is attracted by her more manifest comeliness.
