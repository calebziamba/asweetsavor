_Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship._ _– Romans 12:1_

Our position in Christ has always been a position of consecration. God leads us to follow Him, and gradually we come to see that we have already been offered to God in Christ. We should say, “Lord, I praise You. I didn’t know I was already consecrated to You. I didn’t know I had already given everything to You.” It is His doing that we can present our bodies “a living and holy sacrifice” (Rom. 12:1).
