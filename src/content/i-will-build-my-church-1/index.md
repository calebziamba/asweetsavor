> I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.
> 
> \- Matthew 16:18

You, as a brother, me as a brother, you as a sister, she another sister, we all are individuals. The Lord says, “I want to put you together, not put you together, but build you up together. Everyone has to rely on others. Everyone has to depend on others. Everyone has her value. Everyone can become a supporting element to the testimony of the Lord.”
