_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _— Philippians 1:2_

When we enjoy grace, we not only enjoy an inward peace, we also experience an outward peace related to our environment as we abide under God’s sovereign hand. When we argue and fight with others, it indicates that we are short of the divine life (Gal. 5:13–15). Once a rift occurs, what can restore the peace between arguing Christians or between a husband and wife? It takes more than outward repentance. Even the most sincere repentance may not remove the problem. Only the regular enjoyment of the divine life as grace generates this peace. When we enjoy grace, the Lord comes to us and touches our heart and spirit. He renders us true satisfaction. He becomes so soothing and so comforting. There is something bright and buoyant in our heart. The issue of all this is peace. Having enjoyed the Lord’s grace, we are entirely at peace.
