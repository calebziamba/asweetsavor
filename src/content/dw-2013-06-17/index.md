One who has a personality that is useful to the Lord normally experiences transformation from the beginning of his Christian life. It seems the person is transformed dynamically in a few months. His personality is suddenly changed. He has the divine element and some characteristics of the divine attributes, and he also lives out the human virtues. Perhaps he was an arrogant person, but now the arrogance is gone. He was a worldly person, but now the world is gone. He was a dominating person, but now the insistence is gone.

When he met the Lord, his personality changed. This change is the beginning of the conforming work of the divine life upon him. Now he has a little flavor of Christ. This is not a small matter. The flavor of Christ reveals that a person has the divine personality. Now there is a divine element in his personality.
