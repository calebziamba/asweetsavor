_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

This statement, “Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,” is one of the most difficult portions to understand in the book of Philippians. Oh, how we might wish Paul had followed this by saying, “Sorry for my mistake. I meant to say, ‘We are all saved by grace!’”

Who can work out their salvation? Doesn’t this indicate some effort on our part? How can a salvation we work out be totally of God’s grace?
