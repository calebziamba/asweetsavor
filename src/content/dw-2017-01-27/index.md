_That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._ _â€“ Ephesians 1:18_

This verse shows us that God will inherit His believers. The question is, how much of us can God inherit? Some believers will have a great deal of riches for God to inherit, while other believers will have only a little. If a person was born again but never followed the Lord, God will inherit only that small part of him which was regenerated.
