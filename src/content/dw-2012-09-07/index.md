_King Solomon made for himself a palanquin_ _From the timber of Lebanon._ _He made its posts of silver,_ _Its bottom of gold_ _And its seat of purple fabric,_ _With its interior lovingly fitted out_ _By the daughters of Jerusalem._ _— Song of Songs 3:9-10_

The bottom of the palanquin is made of gold, meaning that the source of the Lord’s move is out from God. Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that if God is not the foundation, our work is useless, regardless of what method we employ.

God will not commit His move to those who are not drawing from His life. We need to pay a price before God. Our personality, temper, habit, and thought should bear the mark of the cross, and we must be those living out God’s divine life as the base of our work. If we have experienced silver, we will also have gold. The redemption of Christ enables us to experience God’s life and nature, and the more we possess of God’s life and nature, the more the palanquin is equipped for the Lord’s move.
