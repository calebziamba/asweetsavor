_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure._ _—Philippians 2:12–13_

So Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him. _— Hebrews 9:28._

When the Lord appears a second time, it will be “for salvation,” that is, for the completion of this great salvation.
