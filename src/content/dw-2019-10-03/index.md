_Epaphroditus \[...\] was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. For indeed he was sick to the point of death - Philippians 2:26–27_

After arriving in Rome, Epaphroditus longed for the fellowship he had with the Philippian believers. Furthermore, Paul wrote that Epaphroditus “was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.” This may not seem to make much sense. If Epaphroditus were sick, shouldn’t others be distressed about him?

Both Paul and the Philippians must have been anxious for him, but the one who was most sorrowful was Epaphroditus. He became extremely distressed when he heard that the church was worried about him. Rarely have I seen such a sweet relationship between a laboring one and a church, but such mutual concern should be our experience in the church life.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 166-167.
