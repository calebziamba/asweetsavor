> But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

What is our goal? It is Christ! Our one focus is to obtain Christ. Our whole life is only for gaining Christ, and the only danger is that we might miss Him. Nothing else matters.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 220
