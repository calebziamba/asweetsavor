To be detailed is a good character trait. However, if it is not developed from the divine nature, a person with this trait will be hard to please. In the meeting he will see that this sister doesn’t have a head covering, and that sister has one but doesn’t wear it properly; this sister’s head covering is too big, and that sister’s is too small. He will discover many problems just by looking at the sisters’ head coverings.

This kind of person has developed a fine character, but only his character has developed; he has not allowed the Lord to transform his nature. Eventually he will have a peculiar personality. Thus, the people whom he serves will find it hard to experience life.
