The two aspects of our new living—the enjoyment of Christ and living for the Body of Christ—are closely related. Ultimately, we can only have the enjoyment of Christ in the body of Christ, and it is our enjoyment of Christ which, in turn, makes us a blessing to the body of Christ. We may even say that all of our enjoyment of Christ is really for the body of Christ.
