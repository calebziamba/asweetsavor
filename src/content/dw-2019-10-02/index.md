_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25–30_ Paul didn’t mention that Epaphroditus had any exceptional talents or abilities, but he appraised him highly, referring to him as his brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier (2:25). I do not believe there is another person in the entire Bible referred to in such an impressive manner. Epaphroditus had been chosen by the church in Philippi and sent as their messenger to Paul to minister to his needs on their behalf. Now Paul was sending him back to them.

Although we may never become another apostle Paul, we can become an Epaphroditus, an outstandingly common brother. Even though he was not particularly talented, he, along with Paul and Timothy, had become approved. This was shown by Paul’s high appraisal of him and by his local church’s willingness to send him.
