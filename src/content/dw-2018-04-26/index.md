_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

Paul had told the Philippians that they appeared as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation (Phil. 2:15). Because they held fast the word of life, Paul had confidence that his running and toiling had not been in vain.
