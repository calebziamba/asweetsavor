_He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son._ _– Colossians 1:13_

It is crucial for us to see that we have received a new position in Christ, because the kind of living we have will be determined by the position we have. Being born again is like migrating from an impoverished country, where there is no hope, to a rich and prosperous country, one with unlimited hope for the future. Spiritually speaking, we are now in a new “country,” a new kingdom with so many riches. We have migrated from the kingdom of Satan to the kingdom of God, and now in our new position, we can enjoy all the marvelous riches that God has prepared for us.
