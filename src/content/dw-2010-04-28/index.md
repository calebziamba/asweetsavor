Afterwards I went to the mess hall for supper. The company commander entered with some papers in his hands, looking very sober. At that moment the Lord told me, “Now you can go home.” The commander announced, “I have just been instructed by the Department of Defense to release immediately all those who have already passed through basic training for the army. You are to leave at once.”

The first thing that I realized was how good the Lord was to me. Had I not repented before receiving this news, I would have been too ashamed to stand before the Lord. Even my repentance was something of His mercy.
