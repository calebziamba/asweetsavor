_For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me. — Philippians 1:6-7_

Brothers and sisters, the apostles should be in our hearts. I first met Witness Lee in 1953, and in 1954 I attended his Life-study of the Psalms. I realized at that time that this brother was a true servant of the Lord. From then on, until he passed away, he was in my heart. He is still in my heart today, and since his passing, I miss his presence.

I am afraid, however, that some churches assess their situation and exercise according to what they feel is most needed, without realizing that in God’s economy, the oneness is produced not by the saints within a locality alone, but also with the servants of the Lord. Therefore every local church should seek after the fellowship of the nearby churches and the fellowship of those who serve the Lord for their sakes.
