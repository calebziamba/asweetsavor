In our nature, we vary. For example, one brother likes to hide his feelings. He is very nice. When he is angry, he will just go home. He wonâ€™t react, contradict, or attack others. Another brother is just the opposite. When he is just a little mad, he appears to be very angry. It is hard to say which nature is better. But after the divine nature is constituted into us, the different natures can be used for the Lord.
