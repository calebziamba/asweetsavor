_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

If we are living a healthy Christian life, we should have a secret with the Lord that is only between us and Him, a love between us and Him that is beyond outward manifestation, for the love we have and the words we tell Him are not for others to know. May the Lord save us and bring us into His chambers more and more.
