_Unless Jehovah builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless Jehovah guards the city, The watchman keeps watch in vain. It is vain for you to rise up early, To lie down late, To eat the bread of toil; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep. — Psalm 127:1-2_ In the church life, the Lord would tell us, “Go to sleep. You are too busy. You are trying so hard to build, to watch, and to labor. Let Me remind you that I love you. You don't need to work so hard. Just go to sleep.”

Not only does the Lord tell us to go to sleep, but He Himself gives us sleep. He gives us rest. When we are so concerned about our local church, He will say, “Rest.” When we are struggling with whether we should serve the Lord full-time, He will say, “rest.” If we are full-time and are wondering if we should get a job, He will say “rest.”
