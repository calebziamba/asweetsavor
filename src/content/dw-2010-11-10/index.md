_Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. — Acts 26:19_ Once we discover what is on the Lord’s heart, we should give our lives to fight for it. David was such a fighter. Too many today are distracted from what the Lord has revealed to them of His purpose. We need to be saved from doing spiritual things with only those things in view. Too often we consider how things will affect or bless others. Instead, we should consider how those things affect or bless the Lord.
