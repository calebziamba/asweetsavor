_“__So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah!  
And he said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me?  
Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then  
have you deceived me?"”  
– Genesis 32:28  
_

Jacob needed not only Laban but also Laban’s two daughters, Rachel and Leah. Rachel he loved and Leah he didn’t (Gen. 29:18, 31), yet they both made him suffer. God had mercy on him and arranged everyone and everything just for him. God makes such arrangements for us also. We should not complain. We should thank the Lord for those He has placed us with. He always has the best arrangement for us in order to mold us into the image of His Son (Rom. 8:28–29).

May we all have spiritual insight so that, rather than complaining, we appreciate God’s blessing and arrangement. What He arranges for us will cause us to lose all our natural self-assurance, boasting, and pride so that we may be transformed from Jacob into Israel.
