_But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. — John 16:13_

When I was young, different ones in the church life sometimes would offend me. According to the teaching in the Bible, I felt as long as a certain brother was in the meeting, I should not take the Lord’s table until I was able to forgive that person. Yet, the strangest thing would happen. We all would begin to sing a particular hymn. Suddenly, I did not feel any more anger toward that particular brother. In fact, this brother looked so pleasant to me, and I realized that I loved him. This occurred because I was brought to my spirit. Once we are in our spirit there are no more divisions, enmities, strife, or differences. They all disappear when we possess the Spirit of reality.
