The first eight chapters of Romans are focused on personal salvation, but the last five chapters talk about this personal salvation leading to our functioning as members of the body of Christ. This is very sweet.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 10.
