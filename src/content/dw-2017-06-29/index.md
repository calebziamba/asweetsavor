_Go to My brethren and say to them, “I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.”_ _– John 20:17_

When Christ was resurrected, He was declared the firstborn Son of God, and at the same time we became His many brothers (Rom. 1:4; 8:29). To understand this, we must realize that as God, Christ was eternally the Son of God (John 17:5), but as a man He shared in our created human nature (Luke 1:31; Col. 1:15). Through His resurrection He was glorified and exalted as a man, and hence as a man declared to be the Son of God. As such a one, He is now “the firstborn among many brothers” (Rom. 8:29).
