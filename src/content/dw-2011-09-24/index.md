_Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;_ _We found it in the fields of Jaar. Let us go into His tabernacle; Let us worship at His footstool. Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, And let Your saints shout for joy. — Psalm 132:6-9_

We must realize that when the reality of God’s habitation comes, the “I” disappears. When the ark of testimony is produced, then all the individuals are gone. There is nothing left but God’s tabernacle.

For us, this means that the Lord becomes the real center of the church life. We no longer have “my tent.” We no longer have anything for ourselves. We only have “His tabernacle.” We disappear, and He alone is seen. We should pray, “Dear Lord, grant us this reality. How long must we wait? How long until we reach this stage? How long until we have a church life where You are everything, where there is only You, and nothing but You? Lord, we want You as the ark of testimony to be the center and reality of the church life.”
