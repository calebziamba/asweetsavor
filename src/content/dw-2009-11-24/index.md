_Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine Within your house, Your children like olive plants Around your table. — Psalm 128:3_

_And he came to him and bound up his wounds and poured oil and wine on them. And placing him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn and took care of him. — Luke 10:34_

In our house there is a “fruitful vine.” Not only do we have wine, we produce wine. Furthermore, we also have olive plants. We produce wine, and we also produce oil.

This is marvelous. When the good Samaritan took care of the wounded man, he ministered oil and wine (Luke 10:34). Oil and wine represent the life supply from the Lord for anointing and for enjoyment. The Lord as the good Samaritan healed the wounded one with these two items.
