_Now you are Christ’s body, and individually members of it._ _– 1 Corinthians 12:27_

Unfortunately, Americans are raised in a culture that is very individualistic, which always tells you to “be yourself.” In this country everyone is encouraged from childhood to do whatever they like so that they can find self-fulfillment. They are told that whatever they consider to be right or whatever they want to do, they should just do. But now, after being born again, everything is different. We can no longer live by ourselves, for we have been born into the body of Christ to live the corporate “body life.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 97-98.
