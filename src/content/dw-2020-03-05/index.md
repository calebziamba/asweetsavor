_"for we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God  
and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,"  
\-Philippians 3:3  
_

Paul gave three aspects of those who are the true circumcision: They “worship in the Spirit of God,” they “glory in Christ Jesus,” and they “put no confidence in the flesh”. These three are in direct contrast to the three things mentioned in verse 2: the dogs, the evil workers, and the false circumcision. We must come to the point that we have no confidence or pride in the flesh. Inwardly, Paul put no stock in such things. He placed no confidence in them.
