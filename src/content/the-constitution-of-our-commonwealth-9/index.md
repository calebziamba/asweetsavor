> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> â€” Philippians 3:20 Darby

What a commonwealth is ours! Christ is its essence, element, and substance. Christ is its inward content. Christ is its power and energy. Here Christ is manifested and testified. He is the constitution of our heavenly commonwealth.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 246
