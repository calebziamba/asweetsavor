_Now again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and it incited David against them to say, “Go, number Israel and Judah.” The king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Go about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people, that I may know the number of the people.”_ _– Second Samuel 24:1-2_

Leaders can also be stumbled by becoming proud of their accomplishments and trying to gauge their success by taking inventory. Businessmen can do this, but spiritual men should not. David committed a sin by numbering the people to measure his strength. When we do such a thing, we are looking for strength in something other than God. It is too easy to take pride in things other than the Lord Himself.
