_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you;_ _And I will make you a great nation,_ _And I will bless you,_ _And make your name great;_ _And so you shall be a blessing;_ _And I will bless those who bless you,_ _And the one who curses you I will curse._ _And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1-3_

There are three items in God’s promise to Abraham: first, “Go forth from your country...to the land which I will show you” (Gen. 12:1); second, “I will make you a great nation” (v. 2); and third, “in you all the families of the earth will be blessed” (v. 3). These three items—land, nation, and blessing—are God’s will.
