_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

Although God has called us, appeared to us, and given us His promise repeatedly, nothing can replace God Himself. He has brought us through many experiences so that we may be blessed and strengthened in order to complete our Christian journey. However, these experiences cannot replace God Himself. God indeed promised us a land but eventually we will testify that in our life we have many experiences of God but we don’t hold anything in our hands.
