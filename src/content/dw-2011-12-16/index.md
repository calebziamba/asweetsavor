_\[Saul\] proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah. He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"  
— First Samuel 19:23-24_

When I consider this picture, I have to laugh and say, “Lord, I cannot but love You. No one is as wise as You.” God was training David to depend upon no one but Himself. It was as if He were saying, “Samuel may have anointed you, and he may be judge, priest, and prophet, but do not trust in him. You must trust in Me.”

These experiences of persecution were to teach David that only God could be relied upon. Although David had trusted God as he confronted the bear, the lion, Goliath, and the armies of the Philistines, his flight to Samuel showed he still had more to learn. As Saul sought to kill David, God was teaching David to rely wholly upon Himself.
