_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

Abraham wasn’t offering up his son just to see him raised from the dead. His feeling was that he had to do it simply because God said so. He had gained God to the extent that he dared not refuse God. God said offer, so he offered no matter how hard it was. He submitted to the Lord and trusted that He would raise Isaac from the dead.
