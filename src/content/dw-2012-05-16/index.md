_"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’" Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me." — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

It is marvelous that whenever we have no way out and no way to go on, one of the brothers will come to us. They are the watchmen who go about in the city. Being the servants of the Lord, they take care of the church. Also, they raise up the young saints. They know that the problem is not your pursuit and exercise, but your disobedience and your unwillingness to deny yourself.

Initially you may not think that their fellowship fits you or is applicable to your situation. Instead, you feel that their answer doesn’t meet your need and that they don’t understand what your problem is. It seems to you that their fellowship is just teaching from older Christians.
