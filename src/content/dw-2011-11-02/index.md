_And the Lord said to Joshua: “See! I have given Jericho into your hand, its king, and the mighty men of valor.”  
— Joshua 6:2  
_  
Jericho, which means "fragrant" (_Strong_), signifies Satan and his authority in the air. Satan surely presents himself as a fragrant, attractive person. He was created in beauty (Ezek. 28:13). When he tempted Jesus in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1–11), I have no doubt he appeared to be more beautiful than Jesus (cf. Isa. 53:2). The first city the Israelites had to defeat was Jericho, which represented Satan’s kingdom.

Jericho must have been a fragrant, attractive city. To those caught in Satan’s kingdom, it is so attractive it seems a shame to destroy it. For instance, shopping malls draw thousands of shoppers every day, yet they are a part of Satan’s kingdom.
