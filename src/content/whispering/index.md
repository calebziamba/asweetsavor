Oh, do draw me, dearest Lord,   
I will follow close to You.  
You’re so full, so boundless, Lord;  
More than I could hope to know.  
Like a pretty henna flower   
Blooming in the barren field;  
As the myrrh with fragrance sweet  
Deeply in my heart concealed.  
Oh, do hear my whisper, Lord,  
There’s no other Lord but You.  
As Your riches I partake,   
In Your life, mature I’ll be.

Words: Titus Chu, 1973, tr. from Chinese, adapted
