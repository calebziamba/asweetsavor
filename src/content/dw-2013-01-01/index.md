_“On my bed night after night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not.”_ _— Song of Songs 3:1_

The Lord’s goal for us is that we would be fully one with Him.  As pictured in the Song of Songs, the first of His dealings with us as He leads us towards this goal is to take away the sense of His presence. As we are enjoying being in the King’s chambers (1:4), He takes away the feeling of the sweetness of His presence. In this way He teaches us that His inner dwelling has nothing to do with our feelings.

At this point the Shulammite’s distress caused her to say, “On my bed night after night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not” (3:1). In our experience we lose the sensation of the Lord’s presence.
