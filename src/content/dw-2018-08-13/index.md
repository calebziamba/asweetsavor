_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

By the renewing of our mind, we are brought through different stages of transformation, and our outward living begins to be more aligned to God’s will. What this looks like is the church life (Rom. 12–16).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 16.
