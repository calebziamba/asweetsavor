When I began to love the Lord, the first thing He told me to do was to take care of the children in the church. Therefore, for ten years, while I was in high school, the military, and college, I taught children the Bible. This is one reason I know the Old Testament as well as I do. I am very glad that I was able to serve in that capacity for all those years. As a young believer, I received my training by serving children.

Today I am seventy, but I do not feel old, for I have been bearing the Lord’s commitment, and I am still bearing it. Even at my age, there is more and more to be done for the Lord’s interest. Our labor can have eternal value. How high is such a life! I hope many who read this would determine, “I may be young in the Lord, but something of eternal value will be manifested through me! What I am giving myself to will be manifested in eternity! I am a person in time, but what I am doing is unto eternity!”
