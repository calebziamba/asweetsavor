_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

Every time you reach a new peak in your spiritual growth, you need to be prepared for Satan’s renewed attack, and you need to ask for the Lord’s preservation. However, be assured that God will only allow Satan to attack you and test you according to your capacity.

Those who lead, those who love the Lord more absolutely, and those who are more committed to the Lord will go through more sufferings. The result of such sufferings, however, is the woven crown of gold.
