> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> — Philippians 3:20 Darby

This commonwealth manifests and testifies only Christ. When others see the church gathering, they shouldn’t see merely a group of good people, or even a group of godly people. Instead, they should say, “Christ is here!” (1 Cor. 14:23–25), for this commonwealth is a testimony of Christ alone.
