_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

_I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing._ _—John 15:5_

We can do nothing apart from Christ (John 15:5). Oh, how low we need to become! The self cannot be allowed to gain credit for anything; the scope of God’s salvation must encompass everything in our lives. In everything, everyday, we must tell the Lord, “I need You to save me today” (2 Cor. 6:2).

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ,”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 118.
