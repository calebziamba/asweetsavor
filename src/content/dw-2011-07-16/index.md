_So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And the Lord said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!” Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah. — First Samuel 16:12-13_

Of course, it has taken me fifty years to apply what I experienced on the day I publicly consecrated myself to the Lord as a young man. It was not simply a “one-time deal.” David, after his anointing, experienced the Spirit being with him all his days. I hope that everyone who has received Christ as their Savior would go on to experience the Spirit. Go before the Lord even for a number of hours to confess any sins or shortcomings as He reveals them to you, and ask Him to fill you. Tell Him you need His Spirit to saturate you so you might become an anointed person.

I do not want to promote a specific way, but every Christian needs to experience the Spirit. The experience of being anointed is something of the operation of the Spirit upon you which sets you apart unto God for His purpose.
