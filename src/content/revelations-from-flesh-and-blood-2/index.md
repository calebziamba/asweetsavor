> Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal _this_ to you, but My Father who is in heaven."

When I see people get drunk, I don’t understand why people get drunk. But some fallen people see it and not only do they see it, they think “that’s it!” So they drink, they gamble, they live an improper life, they are on drugs, and they are doing criminal things. Do you think they have a vision? No. But they do see something. They can tell you, when I’m drunk, I’m so happy. I say how about your headaches? How about your sleeping on the floor? How about the immorality you practice after you get drunk? How about the damage to your liver, the damage to your health? But they don’t see that. You know, brothers, flesh and blood can produce attractive things.
