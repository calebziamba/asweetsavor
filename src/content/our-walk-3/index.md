> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:14 NASB

Christian oneness is the result of our pursuing this unique goal. Our oneness does not depend on us all observing the same practices, such as everyone rising at the same time to pray. Whether we get up at five or eight, whether or not we focus on praying, reading the Bible, or preaching the gospel, we all have the goal of gaining Christ. This goal maintains our oneness in spite of our differences.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 234
