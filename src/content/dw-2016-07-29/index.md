If you trust in your natural genuineness, you will eventually find that your natural genuineness is not sufficient. No matter how genuine you are, it is not good enough. The truly valuable genuineness that is useful to the Lord is developed through the divine nature. More than this, you must exercise the characteristic of genuineness. The exercise of the character according to the constitution of the divine nature will produce a good personality. This will become a great blessing to the Lordâ€™s recovery.
