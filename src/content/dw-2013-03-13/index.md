_Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.” Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the Lord is with you.” – Second Samuel 7:1-3_

Because David expressed this desire, God sent Nathan to him with a word (2 Sam. 7:4–17). He said to David, “Would you build a house for Me to dwell in?” (v. 5). It seems God was appreciative of David’s desire, but did God actually need such a physical house?
