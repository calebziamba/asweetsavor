_The whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one. — First John 5:19_

Look how dark the world is (1 John 5:19); even the news media, which we would hope to be balanced, is biased. Don’t think there is justice—everything in the world is under the authority of the air.

Yet even under this present darkness, God desires to raise up His testimony, His inheritance. When He gains His inheritance, He is joyful and satisfied. For this reason, it is a true service to God when we wrestle against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.
