Abraham wanted a wife for his son Isaac, but he didn’t want Isaac to marry a Canaanite woman. He said to the oldest servant in his house, “I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live, but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac” (Gen. 24:3–4).
