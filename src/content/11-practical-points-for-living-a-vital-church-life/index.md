During the 2016 Winter Vision Week Training in Cleveland, OH, brother Titus Chu took some time to share 11 practical points on how to live a vital church life. These points direct us towards very practical ways we can enjoy Christ, proceed towards the Lord, and see God in our daily life with fellow believers. The eleven points are as follows:

1. Have good fellowship with the elders
2. Have sweet fellowship with companions
3. Preach the Gospel
4. Read the Bible
5. Enjoy Hymns
6. Read Spiritual Books
7. Open Your Home as a Base
8. See the Body
9. See Creation
10. Have Elder-led Conferences
11. Take Assignments from the Church
