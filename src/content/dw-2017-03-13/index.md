_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure._ _—Philippians 2:12–13_

Even the realization that we need such a salvation, the fear that causes us to desperately lay hold of it, and the trembling as we seek to do His good pleasure are all from God. He encourages us, helps us, and enables us to partake of this salvation.
