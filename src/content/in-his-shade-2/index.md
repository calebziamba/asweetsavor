> _In his shade I took great delight and sat down,_  
> _And his fruit was sweet to my taste_
> 
> _â€“ Song of Songs 2:3_

As you progress, ... you will realize that the unlimited life of the Lord supplies all your needs. Eventually, this life will overshadow you, and you will remain under its shade. Life will be over you, and life will be under you as well. You will live completely in the abundance and transcendence of this marvelous life!

Excerpted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](https://www.asweetsavor.org/song-of-songs-dr),_ by Titus Chu, page 78.
