_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

The Greek word used here is katatomē (Strong, no. 2699), which is a derisive term meaning “mutilation.” In Paul’s mind, the physical circumcision the Judaizers promoted was now nothing but mutilation.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 181.
