> Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.
> 
> \- Philippians 3:12 ASV

The Lord has gained us with a strong desire that we would possess Him. We have given ourselves to Christ, but have we embraced all that this entails? If we really want to give ourselves to Christ, we must come to Him, study Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him so that eventually we might fully realize who He is. This takes place by our pursuing Him in a persecuting manner. Then we will discover what a Christ we have.
