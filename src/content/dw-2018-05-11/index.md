_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

According to Romans 1:2–3, both the Old Testament and New Testament Scriptures are concerned with one thing: the Son of God, Jesus Christ.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 5.
