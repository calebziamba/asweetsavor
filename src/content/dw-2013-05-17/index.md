On one occasion two brothers went to a certain locality to give a conference. They had one hour to minister, so each had 30 minutes to share. After the first brother had shared about 30 minutes and was about to finish, the other brother thought the time was up, so he dragged the other brother down and went up himself. Afterwards, the first brother would not dare go out with him again, for that other brother did not know how to coordinate.

Such a problem is not spiritual, but a problem of personality. It is easy to solve a spiritual problem, but very difficult to deal with a problem of personality. Even a tough personality can be a blessing, however, if such a person allows the Lord to touch him and mold him.
