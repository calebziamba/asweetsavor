_Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. â€” John 17:17_

According to John, the God of glory brings us into glory by means of the living Word. This is why we should spend time in God's word, the Bible. Too many spend their time concerned about money or other things. We need to spend time in the word, not as dead letter, but as that which brings us into the flow of life.
