God led man from Genesis 3 through Genesis 8. Whenever man was damaged by the enemy, God always had a way to go forward. When man fell in Eden, God had a way. When Cain slew his brother, God had a way. Eventually, when mixture came in and man showed he was utterly incapable of fulfilling Godâ€™s expectations and hope, God used the flood to judge and destroy what had become absolutely corrupt and to usher in a fresh start.
