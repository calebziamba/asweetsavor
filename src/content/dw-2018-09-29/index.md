In fellowship, no one should insist on or impose anything, and no one should be subdued by anyone. Our focus should be on Christ alone. We fellowship to bring in a flow of life and a mutual dispensing of the riches of Christ. Whatever we have should become a blessing to others, and what others have should become a blessing to us. Paul always took this way. His life was a life of fellowship.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 142.
