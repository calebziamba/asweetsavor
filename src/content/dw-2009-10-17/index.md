_This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you. — John 15:12_ May the Lord be merciful to us! Let us all pray, “Thank You, Lord, that we are born again. Now we want to enjoy and carry out Your commissions. By enjoying You as life and grace, we want to live the Body life. We are not here for ourselves. We are here for Your interests. Strengthen us to carry out these commissions! We give ourselves to You, that we would love one another, keep the oneness, and feed the lambs. Thank You, Lord Jesus.”
