_Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord._ _– Genesis 13:18_

A life of the tent is a life not settled. Those who live in tents are ready to move whenever and wherever God leads. It is easy for us to become settled. If we violate the principle of the life of the tent and become settled in any way, we will have difficulty following God’s leading.
