_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?”_

_“My beloved extended his hand through the opening,_ _And my feelings were aroused for him.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:3-4_

When we were on top of everything in the heavenly realm, all was victorious and satisfactory. Without our realizing it, the vision of the cross faded away. We lived in its victory, but forgot from whence the victory came. We lived in the riches of Christ, but forgot what produced those riches. We departed from the foundation, and as a result, we find ourselves unable to follow Him when He calls us again.
