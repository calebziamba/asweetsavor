> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8-9

Some people are ambitious to pursue a career, some are ambitious to excel in sin, and some are ambitious in serving their church. Paul, however, counted nothing else in his life to be of any real value except Christ. Therefore, nothing else ever replaced Christ as his unique calling.
