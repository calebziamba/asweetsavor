_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

If the Lord has not appeared to us, our serving is like the building of the Tower of Babel. We must ask ourselves, “Am I building a tower or am I serving the Lord?”
