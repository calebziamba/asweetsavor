_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

If you come up from the wilderness, it will be manifest that you have become like pillars of smoke. What does this refer to? When the people of Israel came up from the wilderness, a pillar of cloud and of fire went before them. This pillar led the children of Israel (Exo. 13:20-21).

The Lord’s seeker in the Song of Songs has by this time experienced the Lord’s working in many aspects. She has dwelt in the Lord’s love, and she has experienced the work of the cross. Therefore, she has become such a pillar.
