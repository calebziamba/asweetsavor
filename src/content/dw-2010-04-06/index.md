Sometimes I think that since there are so many Ph.D.’s among us, we should advertise them for the sake of the gospel. We could say on our signs or invitations, “Dr. So-and-So is going to preach.” Many denominations have found this effective.

Every time I am tempted in this way, however, the Lord checks with me and asks, “Although this may yield results, will it build My church? Will it help others to be perfected?” Rather than raising up the brothers or perfecting them, such a thing may ruin them. I thank the Lord for reminding me that this is His recovery. We should not use man’s way to do the Lord’s work.
