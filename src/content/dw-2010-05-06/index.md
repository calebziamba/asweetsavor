_I have given them Your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world. â€” John 17:14_

When someone from my family got married, we requested that only a few people come. There was no fanfare. We had a simple gathering of those close to the family. Why? This is the way to be separated from the world. Then the wedding meeting was so spiritual and high. The testimonies the married couple gave brought tears to our eyes. This was something profound. And this is the way to have the one accord. However, if the world is present, there cannot be one accord.
