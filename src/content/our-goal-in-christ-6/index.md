> But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:13b-14 ESV

In such a pursuit there is no such thing as retirement. There is simply intense forgetting and continual reaching forward to what still lies ahead in the unsearchable riches of Christ.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 220
