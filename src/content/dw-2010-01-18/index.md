_“My mother’s sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept.” —Song of Songs 1:6_

As one who loves the Lord and has a burden to carry out something before the Lord, the seeker has her own vineyard. If you have an intimate relationship with the Lord, you surely will have your own “vineyard”—something that you feel God has committed to you.

This verse indicates that when you rise up to take care of your vineyard, you will come into contact with your “mother’s sons.” Who are these “mother’s sons”? They are the leading brothers who stand for the Lord as the responsible ones in the church life. They take the responsibility in the church, so they are involved with whatever you feel you are committed with. They also arrange other things for you, since you are one who loves the Lord. The responsible brothers rely upon the brothers and sisters who know the Lord and have received something from Him to carry out their burden, so they are often strong with those who love the Lord.
