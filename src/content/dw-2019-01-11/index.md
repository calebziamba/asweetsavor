_And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me._  
_– 2 Corinthians 12:9_

This is the way we walk. In one way, it is very difficult, since we have to leave everything behind. In another way, it is quite easy since God is our way and our portion.
