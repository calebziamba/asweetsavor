_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Fear is experienced within, while trembling is exhibited without. We should fear that we are not completing the salvation we have been given.
