_Therefore also we are determined, whether at home or abroad, to gain the honor of being well pleasing to Him. For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad._

_Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; yet I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences._

_â€” Second Corinthians 5:9-11_

If you desire to speak for the Lord, you must consider what kind of person you are, and when considering your person before the Lord, you should consider such things as how you live before the Lord during the week, how you pursue and live before the Lord, and the condition of your heart and your spirit. Your daily practice affects who you are. If you are in the word, in prayer, and living in the Lord's presence, you will be healthy before the Lord. Then you may become useful to the Lord as someone who is qualified to minister for Him. Only a healthy person is able to speak healthy words.

The kind of person we are determines our ability to serve the Lord. To be able to prophesy, we must be the right kind of person. Prophesying can help others to receive the divine supply. Therefore we must be a proper person. Are we going to fail? Yes. Do we have weakness? Yes. Will we lose our temper? Yes. Will we experience times of being absent from the Lord? Yes. We realize that we are not perfect, and that we have our weaknesses and failures. In many things we do not match the Lord. If, however, we know how to continually come to Him, repenting and confessing our shortcomings, the Lord will have a way to go on with us. We must, however, be sensitive to these things. We must pay attention to our relationship with God. We must be those who are close to God, and we must exercise to live a godly life in the fear of the Lord.
