_And I do not ask concerning these only, but concerning those also who believe into Me through their word, that they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. â€” John 17:20-23_ The church life is a life of oneness, and the living of the church life is a living of one accord. For this we need to see the unique God. He is a God of oneness and desires an enlargement of this oneness. When He was on this earth, He prayed that we would be one.
