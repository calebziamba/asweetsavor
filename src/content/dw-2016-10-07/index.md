_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

When Christ emptied Himself, He did not drop His deity. Inwardly, He was God. Outwardly, however, He was not in the form of God. He took the lowest place when He became a man, not taking the form of a king but of a bond-servant. When He took this form, He emptied Himself of all the rights and enjoyments that He possessed as One who existed in the form of God.
