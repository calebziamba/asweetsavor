> Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.” This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, “Follow Me.”
> 
> John 21:18–19

Also in the church life there are some mature ones. Their consecration is much more than just what I do. Rather, it involves what the Lord desires. How do I walk with the Lord? How do I work with the Lord so that the Lord can fulfill what He desires? That means your hand is stretched out, and you are bound to do what the Lord allows to happen. And we are joyfully abiding in the Lord’s government. At this time, a man who has a vision can joyfully say, “Lord I am so thankful. When I was young, I was a fighter! Now that I am old, I am abiding in you in such a peacefulness and restfulness, yet so girded, so alert, so diligent, to make sure that everything satisfies Christ.”
