_“I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”_ _– Genesis. 15:1, NKJV._

When we follow the Lord to gain Him, we must know from the beginning that it is not our work, not our will, not our love, not our spiritual pursuing, and not our zealousness that will increase our reward and enlarge our shield. We are nothing. It is all God. He is our outward shield and inward reward. The responsibility does not lie with us but with the Lord who does all. He is able to withstand all the flaming darts of the enemy without, and He becomes the life supply within. From now on, we don’t need to say, “Wretched man that I am!” The “I” has disappeared. We need no longer work or struggle. From the beginning to the end, it is all Him.
