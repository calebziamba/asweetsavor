_I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching. —2 Timothy 4:1-2_ We must learn to have Brother Lee’s exercise to be faithful to the ministry and not be satisfied with the revelation we have received thus far. We should never consider that we have already obtained, but we should always keep pursuing and advancing. Brother Lee’s attitude is that he is not satisfied with what he has, nor does he consider himself to have already obtained. He is determined to gain more. Concerning the truth of the Bible and the riches of Brother Nee, he desires to go deeper and higher. We must also have this attitude and determination.
