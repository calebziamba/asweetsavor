> For God, who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.

You know brothers, we should be very happy. When we talk about visions and revelations, they're not something far away that we cannot approach. We all have it already! Do you have a vision? Yes! What is that? Jesus is my savior! Do you have another vision? Yes! What is that? I am a sinner. Do you have a revelation? Yes! When I see Jesus, and when I see myself, and then put together, it becomes a picture. That is the revelation of Jesus. In revelations there are visions.
