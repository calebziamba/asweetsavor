_“Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me; if to the left, then I will go to the right; or if to the right, then I will go to the left.”_ _– Genesis 13:9_

After his experience of failure in Egypt, Abraham seemed blind to material riches. For example, when his servants strove against Lot’s, he didn’t fight to keep the best land. Instead, he gave Lot the first choice.

Because of Abraham’s weakness, he was put to shame. Because of his being put to shame, he was blessed. Because of his being blessed, he overcame the attraction of outward riches.
