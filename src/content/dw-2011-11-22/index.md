_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

The Lord here is not coming to feast with us. Instead, He is coming that we might go with Him to leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills. He desires to constitute His riches, His transcendence, and His power into us in order that they might become our riches, our transcendence, and our power.

He desires to have a deeper, more complete union with us. Through such a union we will enjoy not only His love and presence, but also His death and resurrection. Thus when He comes, He stands there and calls to us, “My beloved, arise."
