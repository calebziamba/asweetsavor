_Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob - Genesis 25:26_

Finally, Esau ran to meet him and embraced and kissed him. Jacob told his brother, “I see your face as one sees the face of God” (v. 10). He saw that God’s hand must have been at work, and his natural efforts to preserve himself were unnecessary. No matter how selfish Jacob was, God’s hand was still on him. He was enlightened and saw God’s face in this experience. This selfish man had some transformation. Though we all, like Jacob, are for ourselves, there is hope for us since God will never let us go.
