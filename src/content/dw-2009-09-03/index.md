_Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live. — John 11:25_ We should also enjoy Christ as the resurrection. Christ said, “I am the resurrection” (John 11:25). Those who enjoy Christ as life are also in resurrection. When we enjoy Christ, we are above everything. We are above the small things, like our concerns for how we look. We are above the big things, like all our concerns for the future. We are above all our problems, anxieties, and situations. When we are in resurrection, we don't care for anything else. We need to be in resurrection so that our Christian life will be high and transcendent.
