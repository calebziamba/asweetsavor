> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
> 
> Matthew 16:25-26 KJV

60-some years ago, I loved the Lord with my soul very much. 60-some years later, I still love the Lord with my soul very much. What’s the difference? It's a different soul. I lost a natural soul. I lost a rotten soul. I lost a mixed soul. I lost the soul that was seemingly after God, but really after myself, or seeming after myself, but always after something else. Eventually, the Lord says, “I’m transforming you.” What is transforming? Transforming is the changing of your soul. Your understanding becomes different. Your appreciation becomes different. What you lay hold of becomes different. The goal of your life becomes different. Your soul decides your person, it decides your existence, it decides your future.
