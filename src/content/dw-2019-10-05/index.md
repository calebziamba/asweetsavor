_\[Epaphroditus\] was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow - Philippians 2:27_

Why would Paul have sorrow upon sorrow? In Philippians 1, Paul was so buoyant, joyful, and heavenly. He knew Christ and knew how to stand in oneness with Him. Why would he be brought down because of one sick brother? Paul greatly appreciated Epaphroditus and his service. Even though Epaphroditus may not have seemed particularly striking, Paul referred to him as his brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and as the Philippians’ messenger and minister to Paul’s needs. There may have been many whom Paul could have spoken of in this manner and who could have cared for his need, but Epaphroditus was one of very few who actually did care for Paul in his situation.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 167-168.
