_Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires._ _– Galatians 5:24_

We should not think that our flesh has been completely dealt with. Paul said, “Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires” (Gal. 5:24). In other words, when you are not of Christ, your flesh is still here. Only when you are of Christ can the flesh be crucified.
