_“I am the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you, and multiply your descendants, for the sake of My servant Abraham.” So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well._ _– Genesis 26:23–25_

No matter how much we plan and work toward our own goals, God will have His way. It is better to be like Isaac who didn’t scheme but obeyed God. He will surely cause us to receive all the riches of our divine inheritance. As we follow Him, we will come to know that we are blessed by God and held in His protecting hand. We may not be clear about where to go or what to do, but we know that we are blessed of God.
