_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Paul called the Philippians “my beloved,” saying, “So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence.” This indicates how much he appreciated them, for he did not use this term when writing to every church.
