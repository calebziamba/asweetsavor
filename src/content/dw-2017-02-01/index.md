_That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._ _– Ephesians 1:18_

Every one of these points should be our joyful proclamation: “I am no longer condemned, I am now justified, I am delivered from the authority of darkness, and I am now joined to the Lord. Praise Him!” We need to enter into the practical enjoyment of all of these items.
