_It is vain for you to rise up early, To lie down late, To eat the bread of toil; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep. Behold, children are a gift of Jehovah, The fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one's youth. How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate. — Psalm 127:2-5_

We must remember that the only way for us to reach this stage of maturity is to go to sleep. “He gives to His beloved while they sleep.” Brothers and sisters, learn not to struggle. Learn to be restful. Learn to take the Lord's hand and abide under His governmental dealing. As you are sleeping, “arrows” will come forth. You will become a “mighty man” with children. These children do not come from your work, they come from you. They come from your growth and maturity.
