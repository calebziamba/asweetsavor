_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

In Romans, Paul shows us that people need to know God’s economy and experience both redemption and salvation. Redemption is for their justification, and salvation is for their growth. They also need to realize God’s sovereignty as they grow (Rom. 9–11). Finally, they need to live in the local church where God has placed them (Rom. 12–16).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 16.
