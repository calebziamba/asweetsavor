_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going._ _– Hebrews 11:8_

God’s appearing attracts us so that we have faith to walk the way of faith and willingly give ourselves to Him. We do this not based on logic but because the Lord calls us onward. He appears and we walk. He appears again and we walk further.
