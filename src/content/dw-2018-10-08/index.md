In terms of how we fellowship, the history of the Plymouth Brethren should be instructive to us. After a dispute on some truth, John Nelson Darby would no longer fellowship with Benjamin Newton. Darby then took issue with George Mueller, for Mueller’s church received some who had been in fellowship with Newton. Eventually, the Brethren movement splintered into hundreds of divisions. They all said that they were for Christ, but approvedness does not issue from this alone. It also requires a willingness to fellowship.
