_If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? — Psalm 130:3_ As for ourselves, we are hopelessly sinful and capable of any evil. After we have such a realization about ourselves, we are enlarged. We no longer have the attitude, “I have grown in life. I have attained something. Now I am able to help the church.” Instead we realize, “Lord, I have nothing. I’m just a sinner. If You were to mark all my iniquities, I couldn’t possibly stand in Your presence. I am utterly dependent on Your mercy.”
