_“I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots”_ _— Song of Songs 1:9_

The Lord compares His lover to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots. As for her ability, she is swift. As for her appearance, she is strong. But as for her personality, she is wild. She is lacking in both the humanity and divinity of the Lord, so she is rough and wild in her pursuing.
