_In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. —œ John 1:4_

Now we will cover more aspects of Christ. Christ is not only a living person for us to enjoy; He is also the supply to meet our daily needs. In the Gospel of John we see that Christ is life to us. He is the bread of life, the water of life, the light of life, and the word of life. Then He is also grace, reality, satisfaction, freedom, the resurrection, and the true vine. The enjoyment of all these riches will supply us to meet all the needs in our daily life.

Our first need is the life of Christ. If we don't enjoy Christ as our very life, then we can't have Christ as anything else in our experience. We must first enjoy Christ as life to us. Only then will we be able to experience Him as all the following items. The enjoyment of Christ as life is the foundation for all our other enjoyments.
