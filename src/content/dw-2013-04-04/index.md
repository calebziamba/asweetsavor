_But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’”_ _– Second Samuel 15:10_

Eventually Absalom asked David permission to go to Hebron to fulfill a vow, and David allowed him to go. His real intent, however, was to be crowned king in Hebron, where David had also been crowned as king over Judah. When David heard that the people favored Absalom, he and his family fled Jerusalem. He knew that if Absalom caught them, he would kill them and perhaps begin a slaughter within Jerusalem itself.
