In addition to enjoying Christ as our bread of life, we also need to enjoy Him as the water of life to quench our thirst. John 7:37–38 says,

_Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’”_
