_“Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has.”_ _– Genesis 24:36_

If we live in the Spirit, He will always reveal something more of Christ for us to experience. We don’t just enjoy living in the Spirit and having the joy of the Spirit. The more we live in the Spirit, the more we experience something higher. We feel that the Lord is new and so wonderful! The evidence that we are following the Lord is that the Lord is fresh and different to us all the time.
