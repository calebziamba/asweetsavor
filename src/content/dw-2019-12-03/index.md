_“While the king sat at his table,_  
_My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.”_  
_– Song of Solomon 1:12, ASV_

Brothers and sisters, how do you come to the point where you can say, “The king is at his table?” That is, how can we know we have experienced a transfer from self-rule to the rule of the King? There are four principles we must apply. First, we need to go forth “in the footsteps of the flock.” Second, we must “pasture \[our\] young goats by the shepherds’ tents.” Third, we need to let God make us “plaits of gold.” And fourth, with the “plaits of gold,” we need the “studs of silver.” These four principles determine whether we are those who can experience what is represented by the phrase, “The king is at his table.”

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, pages 57-58.
