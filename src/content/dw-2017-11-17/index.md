_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

We should not be naive lest we be taken advantage of. Being pure and being naive are not the same thing. Those who are pure are filled with understanding, for they have been enlightened to see what is not of Christ within themselves.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 124.
