_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

The lust of the flesh has to do with satisfying the fallen body, and the lust of the eyes exists for the satisfaction of the soul. Although the religious world includes the lust of the flesh, it focuses mainly upon satisfying the soul with things that involve God’s name and appear right and acceptable.
