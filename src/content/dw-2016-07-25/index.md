Some have a nature that is constantly being transformed. They pray and weep every day, but don’t care about their character at all. They touch the Lord and have the Lord’s presence every day. They know the Lord’s supply, but have no idea about human life. Although the divine nature transforms them day by day, their personality cannot be used for the Lord.
