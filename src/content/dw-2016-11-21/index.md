_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

God’s appearing should control our life. When we have His appearing, we are not affected by people’s criticism. Our only concern is to have a fresh touch with the Lord.
