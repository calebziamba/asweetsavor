_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

We must avoid encouraging others to serve simply in a religious way. I don’t mean we should not encourage others to serve, but their service must be dependent upon God’s appearing to them. The key to serving is not primarily ability but the Lord’s appearing.
