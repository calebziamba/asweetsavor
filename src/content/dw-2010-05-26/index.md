_“As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” — Joshua 24:15b_

God created human beings to express His Son, Jesus Christ, on the earth. Their true potential can only be realized if they become born again as Christians. Once they become Christians, the highest quality of life can only be experienced if they love Jesus. And among those who truly love and even give themselves to Jesus, the highest attainment will be with those who decide to stand for what God is doing on earth according to His heart. Before we talk about serving the Lord, we must have this basic understanding.
