This is the first episode in our interview series. I've been out on the streets hearing how the pandemic has effected people's lives and views on spirituality.Â   
  
In this episode, you'll hear my conversation with Michael. In our conversation he shares how the Coronavirus caused him to come to terms with the fact that he may die if he gets it. And that led in our discussion to consider John 3:16 and the Bible's view of Eternal Life. We will explore more of what the Bible say Eternal Life really is and how we can live this forever life today. Eternal Life is not something we 'wait till we die and go to heaven' for. But it is something we can receive in Jesus now and transforms our life on earth today!  
  
Verse reference:  
John 3:16 (ESV)  
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
