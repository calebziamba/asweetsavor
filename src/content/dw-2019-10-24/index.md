_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

If we want to be approved as Epaphroditus was, we must be ready to be sent out by our local church as he was. Because the church in Philippi sent Epaphroditus, Paul referred to him as “your messenger” (Phil. 2:25). The Greek word for “messenger” here is apóstolos (Strong, no. 652), which can also be translated “apostle” or “he that is sent.” When we talk about apostles, our feeling is that they are great, spiritual men who have raised up many churches. It is true that many apostles do raise up churches, but apostles can also be sent out by local churches. Apostles are those sent out with a commitment. In the case of Epaphroditus, that commitment was to bring a gift from Philippi to the apostle Paul in Rome.

Can our local church send us out with a commitment? If we are not approved, we will not be sent out. Our local church is where the reality of our growth in life, commitment, and service are tested. Everything is tested in our local church.
