_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

No teaching or practice should bring us to that teaching or practice itself. All our teaching and practice must bring us to Christ.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 182.
