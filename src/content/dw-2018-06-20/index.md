_Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are....That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me._ _â€“ John 17:11, 21_

Why is the body of Christ so divided today? Because there is a shortage of this kind of love. Christians often love their doctrines and practices more than they love their brothers and sisters.
