_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

Often we are not clear about the things that happen to us on the path of our journey towards spiritual maturity. Sometimes the Lord appears to us and we do not recognize Him. Sometimes God disciplines us and we do not realize it. Sometimes we do not know why we are in the dark and have lost the Lord’s presence. At other times we do not understand why we are in the heavens experiencing the riches of the Lord. All of these situations indicate that we still have far to go, and that we must pay a further price to go on with the Lord. This is why He says,

_“I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,_  
_By the gazelles or by the hinds of the field,_  
_That you will not arouse or awaken my love_  
_Until she pleases.”_  
_– Song of Songs 3:5_

The Lord must wait until we please.

by Titus Chu, pages 12-13.
