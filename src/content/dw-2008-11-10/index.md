_Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. — Hebrews 13:13_

_But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God. — Acts 20:24_

Paul declared, “Today God's speaking is in the Son. Who is this Son? He was appointed heir of all things, and it was through Him that the universe was made. He is the effulgence of God's glory. You have come to the Christ who is everything in God's economy. Do not waver! Come fully out of the Jewish religion and focus on Christ alone!” This was Paul's emphasis. James had introduced something that was frustrating the organic building up of the Body of Christ. The church in Jerusalem, for instance, was no longer organic, for the law had come in to replace Christ. When certain brothers “came from James,” we are told that even Peter was subdued (Gal. 2:12). But not Paul! He was absolute for God's economy, and he would not tolerate anything that challenged Christ's preeminence.

Paul's ministry was filled with power, truth, eloquence, and energy. He was possessed by the revelations he had received, and he realized that God's economy could only be carried by those who cared for Christ even at the expense of their own life. This is why Paul could prevail in situations where others could not.
