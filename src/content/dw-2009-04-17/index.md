_But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life._ _— Romans 6:22_

When we were born again we were set free, yet at the same time we became slaves: “And having been freed from sin, you were enslaved to righteousness” (Rom. 6:18). To be enslaved means that we have no choice. Even when we try to be unrighteous, something within us compels us to be righteous. Now we are slaves to righteousness.

Even more wonderful than being a slave to righteousness is being a slave to God: “But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life” (Rom. 6:22). We have been set free from sin, death, the world, the flesh, and the authority of Satan. But now we are enslaved to God.
