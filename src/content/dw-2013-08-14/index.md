_“I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.’” — Song of Songs 5:2_

The Lord here calls her “my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one.” The Lord praises her in four aspects. Regarding life, she is His sister; regarding love, she is His love; regarding purity, she is like a dove; and regarding sanctification, she is His perfect one. The Lord asks this beautiful and lovely one to open to Him.
