If we want to know the Bible, we must know the book of Genesis, for as the first book of the Bible, it lays the base for what will follow in all the rest. It begins with the creation itself, and then shows us man’s fall, God’s promised redemption, His calling, and His dealing with those who would answer His call to become His chosen people.

In _A Sketch of Genesis_, Titus Chu deals with these crucial matters, and others as well, from the standpoint of our Christian experience of the growth in life.
