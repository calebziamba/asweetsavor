_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

_And He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”_ _– Matthew 4:19_

The Lord is worthy for us to follow Him all our life. When He first appeared to us, we were amazed to discover that He was so wonderful and precious. As we abide in this initial vision, we have the steadfastness to pass through the many trials and temptations that come our way. In order to truly follow Him, we must abide in this appearing. Many who once loved the Lord stopped following Him when they found a job or married. Our vision is the foundation that enables us to follow the Lord all our life.
