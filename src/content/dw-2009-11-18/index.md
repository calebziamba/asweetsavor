_So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam, a life-giving Spirit. — First Corinthians 15:45_ How can we have the operating Christ in our experience? From where does the anointing come? If we wish to have the anointing, we must have the Spirit, for apart from the Spirit, there is no anointing.

Many believers love the Lord, but how many experience His anointing? In Christianity, many exercise their zeal and human ability, but few know the anointing. Even among us, how many know what the anointing is? Yet, by the Lord’s mercy, because of those who have been raised up among us, we do have some leading that is according to the Spirit and the divine life.

We must all realize that “the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit” (1 Cor. 15:45). We must understand this, and we must function in the church life according to the anointing Spirit, who is the Lord Himself. If we do not function according to the Spirit, our function is not something genuine, and it will eventually be rejected by the Body.
