_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

The second key item regarding the content of Romans is that it is centered on the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord. In the verses above, Paul seems to be saying, “This letter is not centered on me, but on Christ, the gospel!” Paul labored as a bond-servant and apostle, and he had received the gospel from the Lord as his commitment.
