_The men of David said to him, "Behold, this is the day of which the Lord said to you, 'Behold; I am about to give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'" Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly. It came about afterward that David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s robe. — 1 Samuel 24:4-5_

God allowed Saul to come into the cave, and David saw him for what he was. David even cut his “wing.” This showed Saul that he could no longer hurt David. Saul was moved when David revealed what he had done. He realized that David, not Jonathan, would have the throne. Saul, however, soon began to hunt David again. His repentance did not last.
