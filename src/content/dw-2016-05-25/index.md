_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose._ _â€” Philippians 2:2_

In all these matters the mind is emphasized, for our mind is our person. Although Paul never referred to the body of Christ here, this portion is one of the most helpful with regard to the practice of the body life.
