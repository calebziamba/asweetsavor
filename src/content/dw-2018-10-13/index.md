Do not enter into arguments. Do not make issues. Do not try to correct matters. When these things are emphasized, fellowship ceases. Trust that fellowship is able to heal all wounds. Always seek after fellowship.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 144.
