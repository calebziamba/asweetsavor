_“I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies.”_ _– John 11:25_

Because Jesus Himself is the resurrection, those who enjoy Him as life will also be in the reality of resurrection. When we enjoy Christ as the resurrection life, we reign over everything. We reign over the small things, such as our concerns for our appearance, and we reign over the big things, such as our concerns for the future. We reign over all our problems, anxieties, and situations. When we are in resurrection, we don’t care for anything else. Thus, we need to be in resurrection so that we can live an overcoming Christian life, a life in which we reign over everything.
