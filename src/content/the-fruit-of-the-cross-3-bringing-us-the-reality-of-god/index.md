This is part three of a three-part series on the cross by brother Rex Beck. [Click here](https://www.asweetsavor.org/the-fruit-of-the-cross-1-god-is-inward/) for part one or [click here](https://www.asweetsavor.org/the-fruit-of-the-cross-2-the-nature-of-life-within/) for part two.

In this message, brother Rex shares how the cross marked the termination of the old things -- the shadows and pictures of Christ -- and brought us into the reality of the person of God in Christ. In the New Testament age we enjoy the reality of God Himself.
