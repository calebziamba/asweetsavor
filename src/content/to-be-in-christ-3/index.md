The divine and mystical realm is the realm of the Spirit. Consider the following: God is Spirit (John 4:24); the last Adam, who is Christ, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45); he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17); and, the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). To be in Christ is to be in the Spirit and in the divine and mystical realm.
