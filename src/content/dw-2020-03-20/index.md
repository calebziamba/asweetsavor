_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle"  
\-Romans 1:1  
_

No matter how hard we try to understand Paulâ€™s epistles, if we are not slaves of Christ Jesus like him, we will not be able to fully obtain their riches. We must have the same desire, living, and consecration that Paul had. Otherwise, no matter how long we study Romans, we will not be constituted with its riches.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 34.
