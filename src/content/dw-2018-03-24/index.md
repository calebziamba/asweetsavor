_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

In order to hold fast the word of life, we need to be receiving all the time. The word of life within us should not be separate from our living. What we have seen, we need to apply. Then the word of life will work effectively among us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 132.
