_If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? — Psalm 130:3_ When we experience the Lord’s plowing work (Ps. 129:1-3), and as we become more prayerful in His presence  (Ps. 130:1-2), we have a much greater realization of who we really are. This can only come from the Lord’s cultivating work. As we spend time in the Lord’s presence we are exposed. Even though the Lord previously brought us to a certain maturity in life, now we see that we are filled with iniquity.

Then we can pray, “Lord, when I was young, I didn’t realize I was that sinful. I didn’t realize I was that evil. When I was young I was still very bold to do things for You. But now, Lord, I have grown. You have arranged many environments to cut me and deal with me. You have caused me to spend so much more time with You in prayer. Lord, now I have begun to see who I am. How can I come to You? How can I even stand in Your presence? How can I possibly satisfy You? Lord, I am just a sinner, even the chief sinner. I am filled with iniquity. I am a wicked and defeated person. How could You have chosen a person like me? If You marked iniquities, O Lord, who would stand?”
