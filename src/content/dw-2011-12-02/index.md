_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

_Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14_

It is difficult for us to leave behind something we are presently experiencing. It seems that it gets into our blood and we just cannot let it go. The Lord is restless, anxiously hoping that we will notice Him and turn our gaze upon Him.

But alas! We are still focused on some teaching we have enjoyed, our present spiritual condition, the brothers and sisters, our practices, or what we have experienced of the Lord thus far. We do not notice that He is impatiently waiting for us. He calls urgently to us, “Come!” but we do not realize or understand. How poor is our situation!
