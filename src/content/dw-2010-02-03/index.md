_“But I have against you, that you have left your first love. “ — Revelation 2:4_

There are two temptations which exist for co-workers. One is fornication, which is very defiling. The other has to do with the work, which in appearance seems to be something of God. Most would have a strong feeling about fornication, but few will sense the danger of the work. Instead, workers feel fulfilled when they are occupied with the work. When you become overly occupied with working for the Lord in this way, however, your heart becomes useless to Him, for you are no longer touching what is spiritual.

I do not mean that fornication is not serious; it is of course an extremely serious sin against God. What I am saying is that anything that replaces Christ, even though it be something of God, will destroy your heart’s ability to stand before God. We must be careful as we work for the Lord, since those with us will become just as we are. The hearts of the brothers and sisters with us may end up far from God. If this is the case, they cannot become equipped in what is truly useful to God, and the Lord simply will not be able to use them.
