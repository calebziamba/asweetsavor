_“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;_ _I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam._ _I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;_ _I have drunk my wine and my milk._ _Eat, friends;_ _Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:1_

In the past, it was we who looked for the Lord’s supply. Now it is the Lord’s coming to look for us. Before, we asked for the Lord’s forgiveness and His blessing as those who were weak and in need of His mercy. Now we can tell Him, “My heart has become a delightful place to the Lord. Come, Lord. Eat, drink, and enjoy Yourself.” Eventually, the Lord will come and enjoy His work in us, partaking of the fruit of all His labor in our hearts.
