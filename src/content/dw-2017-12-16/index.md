_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

_And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent._ _– Colossians 1:18_

The only way to escape from the religious world is to allow Christ to have first place in all things (Col. 1:18). If Christ truly has the first place in our lives, then we will be able to live as children of God above reproach in this evil and perverse world.
