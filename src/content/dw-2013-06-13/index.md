Everyone was born different. Some were born pleasant, and some were born salty, but a good personality is something that can only be produced with divine help. No matter whether your nature is nice or grumpy, you must meet the Lord, touch the Lord, consecrate yourself to the Lord, and live for the Lord if you desire to have a good initial constitution of your character.
