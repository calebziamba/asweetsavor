_“Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name.”_ _– Genesis 11:4_

Even a Christian work can be in the principle of rebellion if we use it to build up ourselves and gain a name. God has His portion, and we want ours. God’s name is proclaimed, and we want ours proclaimed also. God has a throne, and we want ours. When we are in this situation, God cannot accomplish anything with us.
