_Then behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.”_ _– Genesis 15:4_

After Abraham produced Ishmael through Hagar, God appeared to him again and told him he and his household needed to be circumcised (Gen. 17). God also told him that he would have a son, Isaac, through Sarah (v. 19). Once Isaac was born, Ishmael mocked him, which led to Hagar and Ishmael being cast out under God’s direction (21:9–14).
