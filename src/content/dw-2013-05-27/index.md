I am saddened when I see some brothers grow more and more crooked. When I was young, my thought was that since we are brothers who have the same Spirit and are like-souled, I am for you and you are for me. Together we are for the Lordâ€™s purpose.

Now I realize that it is hard to find, among hundreds or even thousands of people, one who really desires the Lord. Even when people love the Lord very much, they are still affected by something else. It is not something intentional. It is their personality.
