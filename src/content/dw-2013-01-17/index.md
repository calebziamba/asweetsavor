_“You are altogether beautiful, my darling,_ _And there is no blemish in you._ _Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:7-8_

The Lord is also with her on the top of Senir. “Senir” means armor, referring to the church, which puts on the whole armor of God in Ephesians chapter 6.

In other words, you need not only to be in the heavenly places and in the reality of the spiritual things; you also need to put on the church. The armor is for the spiritual warfare. The real warfare can be successful only when you are with Christ on the ground of ascension and in the church.
