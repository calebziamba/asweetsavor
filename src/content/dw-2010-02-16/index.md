_“Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight.” — Ruth 3:2_

Naomi directed Ruth according to her knowledge of what Boaz was doing. She knew that he was winnowing his barley at his threshing floor during the night. This is very meaningful, for our thought is often that the Lord’s activity is in the glorious light of day. When the Lord truly moves, however, it is often during the night.

If you desire to find the Lord you will be brought into trials, sufferings, and difficulties. In this atmosphere, all that prevents the full expression of resurrection can be removed. Winnowing removes the shells that cover the seed. By passing through the winnowing process of the night, the resurrection life represented by the barley can come forth more richly and become a blessing to anyone who touches it. By passing through the night experiences, resurrection life becomes powerfully manifested.
