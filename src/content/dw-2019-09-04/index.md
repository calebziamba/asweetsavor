_Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s plan of election might stand, not by works but by Him who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”_ _\- Romans 9:11-12_

God chose Jacob and set him apart from his mother’s womb (Rom. 9:10–13). When he struggled with his brother Esau within their mother, God said to Rebekah, “Two nations are in your womb...and the older shall serve the younger” (Genesis 25:23). This is God’s calling, which will never change. No matter how crafty, selfish, and stubborn Jacob was, no matter how much he resisted God, God gained him and made him into a glorious Israel. God’s calling and promise can never change.
