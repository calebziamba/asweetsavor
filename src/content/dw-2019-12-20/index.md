_“Your eyes are like doves.”  
– Song of Songs 1:15  
_

A person with spiritual insight knows how to serve properly, for he makes his decisions not for his own sake, but with the Lord alone in view. Without spiritual insight, we can only make decisions according to the outward situation. Some people like exciting meetings. If we possess spiritual insight, however, we will realize that many meetings, which from our point of view seem so good, are actually not profitable from God’s perspective. If we have spiritual insight, we will consider and realize that it doesn’t matter how exciting a meeting is. What is important is how much a meeting supplies the church.
