_And He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”_ _– Matthew 4:19_

Peter was simple when Jesus called him. Jesus was a Nazarene who had no outwardly attractive appearance, stately form, or majesty (Isa. 53:2), but when He walked beside the Sea of Galilee, Peter was attracted to Him. Jesus said, “Follow Me” (Matt. 4:19), and Peter immediately left his fishing nets and followed Him.

Peter was simple. He didn’t consider, “You are a Nazarene. How can I follow You? Where are You going? What is my future if I follow You?” He simply followed Jesus.
