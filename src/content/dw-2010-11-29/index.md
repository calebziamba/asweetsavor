_I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. â€”Romans 12:1_ We often talk about enjoyment. However, the reasonable service is not necessarily something we enjoy. To serve in parking during a conference is not enjoyable. Driving ten hours to attend a conference meeting only to sit beside a crying baby is not enjoyable. We may not be happy, but the Lord is happy, because we are a living sacrifice; we are being burned. Whether we are ushering or attending a meeting, we are serving. Service goes beyond what we do. Service relates to how we are one with the Lord in what the Lord is doing.
