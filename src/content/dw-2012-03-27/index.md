_A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless the Lord, all servants of the Lord, Who serve by night in the house of the Lord! Lift up your hands to the sanctuary And bless the Lord! May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth. — Psalm 134:1-3_

Psalm 134 shows us that the psalmist’s exercise has helped bring the Lord’s testimony into maturity. This is the significance of “all you servants of Jehovah.” When we enter into the experience of this psalm, it is not only we ourselves who are different, but all of the saints are also different. The entire church life is different. By their enjoyment of the divine anointing and the freshness of Christ’s resurrection, all of the saints possess a certain degree of maturity.

This psalm does not speak of the maturity of one individual but of the entire Body of Christ. The servants of the Lord here are not just the leading ones. When the church life is brought into maturity every saint becomes a servant of the Lord.
