> I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity
> 
> \- Philippians 4:12 NASB

Though Paul was mainly speaking of being full or hungry physically, this can be applied to our psychological and spiritual need also. We all go through times of being full. We also go through times of hunger. That is when we are tried. When we are filled, we may become proud. When we are hungry, we may look to things other than Christ. No Christian has the Lord’s presence continuously. No one has an open door all the time. When we are very much in need, we shouldn’t be bothered, because Christ within us is our unfailing strength to lift us up.
