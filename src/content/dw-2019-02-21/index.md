_I recall your tears._  
_– 2 Timothy 1:4_

Paul surely committed a heavy burden to Timothy when he urged him to “remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines” (1 Tim. 1:3).

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 157.
