_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

Like Isaac, we are the center of God’s plan. Did Isaac have weaknesses? Yes, but he was still the center of God’s will. In God’s will, He doesn’t give us up because of our weaknesses and failures. Instead, He continually deposits Himself into us so that we can manifest Him. Compared to His will, our victories, failures, strengths, weaknesses, ups, and downs mean nothing. Those who don’t know the will of God feel their weaknesses and failures all the time and may even be paralyzed by them. However, those who know the will of God are not distracted by them.
