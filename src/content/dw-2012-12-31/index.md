_"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the secret place of the steep pathway, Let me see your form, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely."_ _— Song of Songs 2:14_

In the second chapter of the Song of Songs, the Lord called to His seeking one, “In the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the precipice, let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice.”

The Lord will not let us go until we have fulfilled this expectation. It is this goal—that we remain in the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice—that determines how He leads and deals with us.
