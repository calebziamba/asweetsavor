_“There is Solomon’s bed._ _Sixty mighty men surround it,_ _Of the mighty men of Israel._ _All of them are wielders of the sword,_ _Expert in war;_ _Each man has his sword at his side,_ _Guarding against the terrors of the night.”_ _— Song of Songs 3:7-8_

The Lord will make the fallen ones His bed! There are 60 mighty men surrounding the bed. All of them wield the sword because of the terrors of the night.

Before the Lord returns, who can deal with Satan’s work and attack? Only those who come up from the wilderness. They have experienced death and resurrection, so nothing can touch them. Even in the midst of Satan’s threatening, the Lord has rest through them.
