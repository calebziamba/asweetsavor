Even before his salvation, Paul was marked by sincerity. He was so sincere in his zeal toward God that he tracked down the followers of Jesus and dragged them off to prison, even to their deaths. The zeal with which he served God as a Pharisee was absolute (Phil. 3:5–6, Acts 9:1–2; 22:3–4).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 138.
