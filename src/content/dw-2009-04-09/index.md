_Draw me; we will run after you. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will rejoice in you and be glad; We will extol your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you. — The Song of Songs 1:4_ When the king draws “me” (singular) into his chambers, the result is that “we” (plural) “will be glad and rejoice in you”; “we” (plural) “will extol your love more than wine” (v. 4). Because you had the experience, the others are glad and rejoice in the Lord. This indicates that your individual, hidden experience in the King's chambers affects others. You are not alone, but attached to others. As a result of your experience of the chambers, you have an expression and manifestation that causes the other virgins to be glad and rejoice in the Lord.

A person with the experience of the Lord's chambers doesn't need to shout or talk too much; he will give others the feeling that he is like a bridegroom on his honeymoon. He will be joyful, buoyant, and full of life. This kind of person can bring others to the Lord and can even cause others to extol the love of the Lord.

Who can help others to love the Lord? Those who are in the experience of the love of the Lord. If you are permeated in His love and are enjoying a sweet relationship with Him in your spirit, it is easy for you to help others to love the Lord. People that meet you will realize that the love of the Lord is better than wine. Your fresh enjoyment in love causes others to rediscover the love of the Lord. It is not your speaking so much that renders real help to others; it is your being in life. A person in life can really affect people. Because of you, others will say to the Lord, “We will be glad and rejoice in You; we will extol Your love more than wine.”
