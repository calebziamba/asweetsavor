###### [Article 4: How to Study the Bible](https://www.asweetsavor.org/wp-content/uploads/fellowship-for-full-timers-04.pdf)

If we desire to study the Bible properly the first thing we must take care of is our person. We must deal with ourselves so that before the Lord we are one who is simple, consecrated, and spiritual.

Then when our person is right we must take care of our way of coming to the Bible. First, we need to learn the facts, and based on knowing the facts we can go on to receiving inspiration, learning the truth, and, ultimately, having the light of the word.

Every full-timer must pay attention to the growth in life. Your growth in life will eventually lead you to a maturity in life.

The divine life we have received includes three things: the divine life with its sense, its nature, and its operation.

The secret of serving the Lord full-time is to serve according to these three “E’s,” three “P’s,” and three “C’s.” The three “E’s” are for your person: Have Expectations, Exercise, and be Energized. The three “P’s” for your daily life: Pursue, be Perfected, and Preach. The three “Cs” for your labor: In the Church, with the Co-workers, and with Companions.

To serve the Lord is not a simple matter. In order for you to be a proper person to serve the Lord, you have to grow in life, truth, and operation. This requires that you grow in life, come to have a measure of maturity, and learn how to exercise according to that maturity.
