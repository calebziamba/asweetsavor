_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

_Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ._ _– Ephesians 1:3_

We inherit all the riches in the Son (Rom. 8:16–17; Gal. 3:29), and we are blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places (Eph. 1:3) so that we may joyfully walk the way of the Lord. God the Father is the source and strips us of everything but Himself. We have only Him. This is the experience of Abraham. We are also in the Son and inherit all the divine riches. This is the experience of Isaac.
