_“Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? Where do you make it lie down at noon?” —Song of Songs 1:7

_Noon is the “full” time of a day, as Proverbs 4:18 states, “But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.” “To lie down” certainly means to rest.

Therefore this verse indicates that the seeker desires to enter into something further with the Lord, for she is not finding satisfaction in her attempt to serve Him. Now she is no longer focused on carrying out a work, but on the supply and the full rest in Christ.
