Vision is a crucial matter to every Christian. Actually, if I can say this, no Christian could tell you, “I don't see a vision.” If he or she does not see a vision, they couldn’t be saved. Salvation comes from the first vision, which included revelation. I see a vision of salvation. In this vision I have the revelation of Jesus as my savior. He died for me and his blood cleansed me from all of my sins. Now in this vision I see another revelation. I am poor. I am a sinful man. My sin needs to be cleansed. I need the blood of Jesus to wash my sins away. Maybe at the same time I see another vision. I live in the corrupted world. Everything surrounding me is corrupted. All kinds of things are corrupted and I must come out of it.
