_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father._  
_– Philippians 2:22_

Eight factors qualified Timothy to be approved: 1) he became an encouragement to Paul; 2) he was of kindred spirit with the apostle Paul; 3) he was recommended by the churches; 4) he showed his genuineness in tears; 5) he knew the organic order in the body; 6) he pursued with healthy companions; 7) he knew the Scriptures; and 8) he served like a child serving his father in the gospel.
