_Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the Lord our God, Until He is gracious to us. — Psalm 123:2_

The Lord is a Lord of supply, and He is also a Lord of support. The Lord does everything to supply us, but we don't always know how to take His grace and enjoy His provision. Instead we often argue with Him. We ask, “Lord, why me?” The Lord supplies the best for us, but we complain. At such times the Lord's hand becomes a hand of support.

This is surely precious. When we refuse to take His supply, then His hand of support will come. The only thing we must do is continue to look at Him. Our concept is, “Now that I have consecrated myself to the Lord, I will overcome!” But the Lord's divine concept is, “Now that you have consecrated yourself, you must keep your eyes upon Me. When you come to Me, I will give you My very life supply. However, you are still going to make many mistakes, and there will be times when you won't accept My arrangement or My provision for you. But don't worry. Even when you cannot take it, still look unto My hand. Still look unto Me. Still come to Me. I will give you the support you need to receive My arrangement and My supply.”
