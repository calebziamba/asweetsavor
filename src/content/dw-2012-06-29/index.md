_The next day John the Baptist saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! — John 1:29_

Knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. — 1 Peter 1:18-19

The name “En Gedi,” where David dwelt in the stronghold, means “the fountain of the kid” (Strong). When we first came to the Lord, we experienced Him as the Lamb of God without spot or blemish (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:19). In the light of the Lord’s purity and love toward us, we realized how worthless and terrible we were. As we confessed our sins that day, we prostrated ourselves before the Lord in our shame and sense of utter worthlessness.

Eventually, we learned to trust not in ourselves but in our resurrected Lord who is able to uphold us, save us, and bring us through. This was David’s experience at En Gedi. He learned that he could trust in the Lord.
