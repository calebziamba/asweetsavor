_No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His body._ _– Ephesians 5:29–30_

We are now members of the body of Christ, which means that we are members of Christ Himself. However, before we were saved, all of us were taught to be individualistic, and this affects our understanding of salvation. When we first prayed to the Lord to receive Him, we assumed that our salvation was for ourselves. We certainly didn’t have any thought that our salvation was for Christ, or that the Lord would tell us, “You were saved to be a member of My body.”
