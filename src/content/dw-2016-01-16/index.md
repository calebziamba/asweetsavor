_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... â€”Philippians 2:1_

When we begin to see, understand, and experience the purpose for which the Lord called us, we experience true encouragement. Such encouragement only comes from being one with the divine calling. It elevates us to a higher plane. The more we are captured by divine revelation, the more we experience this encouragement.
