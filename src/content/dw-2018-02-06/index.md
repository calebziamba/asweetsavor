_Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed”; and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit._ _– 1 Corinthians 12:3_

Suppose we wake up in the morning and simply feel down. There’s no need to remain in such a state. Instead, we should open the Bible and begin to call on the Lord’s name, even just a little (cf. Rom. 10:12–13 and 1 Cor. 12:3). We can call out from deep within our spirit, “Oh, Lord Jesus; Oh, Lord Jesus!”

We can also turn to the Bible and read one verse, and then call on the Lord again and pray for just a little while. Then we can read another verse and pray again, just a little. It doesn’t need to be long, perhaps just ten or twenty minutes, but soon we will be filled with Christ as our life
