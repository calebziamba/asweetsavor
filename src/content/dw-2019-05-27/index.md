_“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

When we had no heart for the Lord, we only had friends for companions. At that time, we could talk to our friends about all sorts of things, such as movies, sports, and our plans for the future. When we began to love the Lord, however, we learned that there were so many others who loved the Lord just as we did. These are the virgins. They are chaste and pure. They care for nothing else but loving the Lord.
