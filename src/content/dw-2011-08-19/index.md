_“I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not stir up nor awaken my love Until she pleases.” — Song of Songs 2:7_

When the Lord’s seeker has reached this stage, she tends to remain there for some time. She enjoys the Lord every day. She considers the Lord wonderful. Other saints may not be so happy about her, for it seems she can do nothing but pray. Therefore the Lord forbids them to meddle with her.
