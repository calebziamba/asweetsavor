_Then the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually._ _– Genesis 6:3-5_

God never gives up. Even when man fell to the point of having children with fallen angels, God didn’t give up. Man was hopeless, but God was still working. When He could no longer carry out His will through man, He carried it out Himself, doing His work according to His will.
