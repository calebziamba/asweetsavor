> Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.
> 
> \- Philippians 3:12 ASV

It takes us all our lives to find out how rich, virtuous, able, and wise this One who has laid hold of us is. The more we know Him, the more we want to press on to lay hold of Him.
