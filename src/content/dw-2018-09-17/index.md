The third factor related to Paul’s approvedness was his pursuit of the truth. Three years passed between Paul’s salvation and his visit to Jerusalem (Gal. 1:15–18). During this time, he went to Arabia. Many Bible scholars believe that Paul devoted himself to study the Word during this time. Afterward, the Old Testament was no longer the same book Paul had come to know at the feet of Gamaliel (Acts 5:34; 22:3). It had instead become a book full of visions and revelations of Christ.
