_A river went forth from Eden to water the garden...._

_— Genesis 2:10a_

_Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water._

_— John 7:37-38_

In His operation as the divine stream, Christ brings enjoyment to those who receive Him. According to Genesis 2:10, the river flows out of Eden, which means “pleasant” or “pleasure.” Christ as our river becomes a source of joy to us. Praise Him! His desire is to become our enjoyment. The Lord also told us that whoever drinks of Him would experience rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being (John 7:37-38). Thus we see that Christ is not only the source of this flow, but He also is the very flow that operates within every regenerated believer.

Christ in His work, His operation, and His ministry comes to us as a divine stream to work and operate within us subjectively. Whenever we touch this stream, we are inwardly enlightened, strengthened, and satisfied. Why is this? It is because Christ as a flow of life operates within us subjectively. In His New Testament ministry Christ dispenses Himself as life into us. This dispensing of life is the ministry of Jesus Christ, and those who participate in Christ's dispensing flow become a part of Christ Himself (1 Cor. 12:12). Then they themselves take part in carrying this flow. In this way the divine stream of the Lord's ministry is carried forward and dispensed today.
