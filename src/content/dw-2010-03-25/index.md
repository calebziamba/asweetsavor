_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

When the “plow” comes in our experience, it is not pleasant. It makes us as low as the ground. We feel that we are abased. We are overwhelmed with difficulties. At the same time, we feel that the cutting of the plow is too painful. The suffering seems so unnecessary. But again, after it is over we eventually realize that it was all at the right time and in the right place.
