_So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father's household heard of it, they went down there to him. Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him. — 1 Samuel 22:1-2_

In You, O Lord, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed; In Your righteousness deliver me. Incline Your ear to me, rescue me quickly; — Psalm 31:1

Israel occupied a very small strip of land, and within that small strip, David and his men initially occupied only the cave of Adullam. Starting from this cave, the Lord developed what would become David’s kingdom. As David and his army advanced from the cave of Adullam and began moving about Israel and its surroundings, much of their movement was in response to Saul’s persecution. During this time, the Lord trained David not to fear but to trust Him unconditionally. David matured to the point that he no longer feared Saul or any other threat. He realized that he was in the Lord’s hands and should rest in Him and enjoy His salvation.
