_"Then I passed by you and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for love; so I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness I also swore to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became Mine,” declares the Lord Jehovah. Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil." — Ezekiel 16:8-9_

_And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. — First Corinthians 6:11_

According to Ezekiel 16, the covering, the washing, and the anointing are all accomplished by the Lord. How do we come to the Lord? We come based upon His covering for our protection, His washing for our redemption, and His anointing for His constituting work within us. We come to the Lord bringing what He has worked upon us and within us.
