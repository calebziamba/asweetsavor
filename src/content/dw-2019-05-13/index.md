_“For your love is better than wine.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2_

In the first part of this verse the seeker spoke of “him,” but now she says “your.” In this lover’s world, there is only “him,” “you,” and “me.” Our “Him” is the Lord, and our “You” is also the Lord. What we want is “Him”—the Lord—and “You”—also the Lord. This thought is similar to what the psalmist says:

_Whom have I in heaven but You?_  
_And besides You, I desire nothing on earth._  
_– Psalm 73:25_
