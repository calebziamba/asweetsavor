_It is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living soul"; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. —1Ã‚Â Corinthians 15:45_

_“The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.” — Romans 8:16_ We can only experience the life of God by touching the Spirit within our human spirit (Rom. 8:16). The Spirit brings us into all the reality of what we received when we were born again.

Before we were born again God was very objective, theoretical, and untouchable. We didn't know God and could not see God. God cannot be seen with human eyes, but He can be realized in our human spirit! The life-giving Spirit has one function, which is to impart the life of God into us. Whenever we exercise our human spirit, the life-giving Spirit begins to operate. And the more the Spirit operates, the more we partake of the riches of the life of God within us.
