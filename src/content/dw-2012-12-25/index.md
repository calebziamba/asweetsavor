_And so it was, that when the bearers of the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. And David was dancing before the Lord with all his might, and David was wearing a linen ephod._ _â€” Second Samuel 6:13-14_

How good it would be if we all could be so free before the Lord! When we speak for the Lord, it should not be with fear but boldly with all our might. If that were the case, how prevailing we would be! The whole picture here is a joyful one of David, the Lord, and the Israelites enjoying a wonderful time together.
