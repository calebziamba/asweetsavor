_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

What did the Philippians need to be saved from? They needed to be saved from the most dangerous thing confronting anyone who loves the Lord: the self-life. Regardless how much spiritual experience and maturity we gain, our self-life can never be allowed to boast.

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ,”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 114-115.
