_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_ Psalm 132 shows us a mature saint who knows how to rest, how to be in submission, and how to wait on the Lord. Yet in this situation of restfulness he still has a desperation. This may seem like a contradiction, but it is accurate according to our experience. The times when we are most anxious are often the times that we are most restful, and the times when we are most restful are often the times that we are most desperate. What is it that we are desperate for? We are desperate for the substance of the Lord’s testimony to be produced.
