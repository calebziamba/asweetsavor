_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1_

In following Christ, difficulties are nothing. What is important is that we gain Christ in our difficulties. When we are going through hardship and the Lord seems far away, we should realize that He is still with us, and we can still gain Him.

We should have such experiences as we are following the Lord. No matter what we would like Him to give us outwardly, God’s intent is to give us Christ.
