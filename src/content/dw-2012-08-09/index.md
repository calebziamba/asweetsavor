_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _â€” Song of Songs 3:6_

A person who comes up from the wilderness has a clear purpose. Her life is a purposeful journey that takes the good land as its goal. Her aim is to gain all the riches of the Lord. She will continue forward on this journey regardless of suffering, tears, or any attempt to influence her towards another direction. For such a one this world holds nothing.

Brothers and sisters, the experience of coming up from the wilderness may seem to be so spiritual that we cannot attain it. However, when we are separated from the world and are seeking the Lord alone, this experience spontaneously becomes ours. Once we have put aside our future and no longer have any plan for ourselves, we will bear the mark of one who is coming up from the wilderness.
