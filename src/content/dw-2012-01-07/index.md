_Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you. — Philippians 3:15_

_Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us. — Philippians 3:17_ Paul’s desire for the believers was that they would all walk according to such a mind as he had. If not, then their oneness would be shallow and unsubstantiated. We must have the mind of the apostle, which is to gain Christ, win Christ, persecute Christ, and pursue Christ, with the goal of becoming so one with Christ. The substance of oneness comes by this kind of pursuing.

Oneness is experienced by a group of people when they are willing to die as a sacrifice for the Lord, when they are willing to pursue and gain Christ, when they operate according to Christ, and when they are fellowshipping in the sufferings of Christ. Without these, there is no real oneness. We must together become imitators of the apostle (3:17). This is the secret of oneness in the church life.
