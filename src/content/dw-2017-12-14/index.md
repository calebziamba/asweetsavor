_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

There is a kind of pleasure involved in sitting and listening to things pertaining to God even when they do not help us come closer to Him. A charismatic preacher may begin a ministry which is honored by others. It seems to be something of value, but it can subtly turn us aside from what God desires.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 128.
