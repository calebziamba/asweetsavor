_King Solomon made for himself a palanquin_ _From the timber of Lebanon._ _He made its posts of silver,_ _Its bottom of gold_ _And its seat of purple fabric,_ _With its interior lovingly fitted out_ _By the daughters of Jerusalem._ _— Song of Songs 3:9-10_

The palanquin’s seat is of purple, which speaks of nobility and kingship. We will manifest kingship to the degree that we experience God’s redemption and receive God’s divine nature.

The Lord’s palanquin is inlaid with love from the daughters of Jerusalem. Originally, all the virgins loved only the Lord. When you become a palanquin, all the virgins will also love you. Have you noticed that when your love to the Lord is stale, the saints seem to love you less? The more you love the Lord, the more the Lord’s lovers will also find you lovable.
