> You have done well to share with me in my affliction
> 
> \- Philippians 4:14

Those who are true servants of the Lord bear the mark of the cross of Christ. Their living is marked by affliction. The apostle Paul was such a person. He was in affliction because he had a charge, a goal, a purpose: to satisfy the Lord’s desire. When Paul was in affliction, Christ was with him to strengthen him (Phil. 4:13), but he also needed coworkers and churches to stand with him. This is why he genuinely appreciated his coworker Epaphroditus and the church in Philippi. Without their care, even Paul, a spiritual and powerful apostle, would have been limited in his service.
