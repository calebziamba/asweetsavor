_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

Silver signifies redemption, and studs of silver again refer to the work of the cross. If you wish to follow the Lord and live before Him, He will make you studs of silver.

In other words, He will let the cross work on you. God wants to separate His “mare among Pharaoh’s chariots” (v. 9) from the world by making her studs of silver. God wants you to pass through the experience of His redemption and gain redemption through grace.
