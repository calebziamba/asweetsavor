_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

It is possible to do something in the Lordâ€™s name that damages people by drawing them away from Christ. If we are not aware of the work of such religious people and are drawn away by them, we may not even realize it when we stop following Christ.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 181.
