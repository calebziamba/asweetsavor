_For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit. â€” First Corinthians 12:13_

We have seen that when we were born again we received the necessity of a new living. This new living has two aspects. The first aspect, which we have covered, is the enjoyment of Christ. The second aspect of this new living is that it is for the Body of Christ and the practical church life.
