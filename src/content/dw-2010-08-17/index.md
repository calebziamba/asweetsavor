_“Your cheeks are lovely with plaits of ornaments.”_ _— Song of Songs 1:10a_

The beauty of our face is partially determined by our cheeks. But hair properly arranged can help our cheeks look good. Verse 10 says that our beauty is due to our ornamentation. Some women know how to make their hair beautiful so as to get more male attention. The one who loves the Lord, on the one hand, doesn’t want to be looked at, because she realizes she is black. On the other hand, she knows how to make herself beautiful so that her loveliness might be noticed.
