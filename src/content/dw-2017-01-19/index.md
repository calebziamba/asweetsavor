_\[You are\] being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts._ _– 2 Corinthians 3:3_

We are letters of Christ, but we must still allow the Lord to write on us. For example, if we desire a certain person to get saved and we pray for them, the Lord will write on us as we pray. This means there is something of Christ on our hearts that can be read, both by the Lord and by the brothers and sisters. We should tell the Lord, “Lord, now I am here to be written upon by You.”
