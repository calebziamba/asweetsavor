_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

If a father demanded respect and honor because of all he did for his family and continually pointed out how they owed everything to his hard labor, that family would experience no real love or joy. To empty ourselves is to drop whatever status, position, or claim we may have.
