_But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. — John 16:13

_If we only avoid the world, this is still passive. We also need something very positive. We must possess the Spirit of reality, which will guide us into all reality We need to shout, “I have the Spirit,” until we are filled in spirit. Then we will not have any problems with anybody. If we have problems with others, it means we are not in spirit.
