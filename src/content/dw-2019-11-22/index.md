_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God_ _–_ _Romans_ _1:1_

The opening phrase of Romans, “the gospel of God,” actually defines the very nature of this gospel. It is of God! In other words, the gospel belongs to God and is related to His will. It is holy and heavenly, reveals God, is full of God, and is meant to bring people to God.

The apostle Paul realized what the gospel was, and this caused the gospel to become the center of all his life and living. Because of who he was, all of Paul’s epistles talk about the gospel of God, not just Romans. Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and all the rest are all books centered around the gospel of God. If we read the Bible under such light, we will worship the Lord, for everything He reveals to us from the Bible is centered on the wonderful gospel.
