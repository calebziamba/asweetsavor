This is the fourth hymn time shared during the January 2009 [Jesus Lovers’ Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/)

In this session brother Titus continued to work with the young people on how to use and enjoy hymns, focusing on some of the songs they typically use in their gatherings. He states that it is not wrong to be excited in the meetings, but for that to be real we need to spend much time privately in the Lord’s presence. If we desire a strong corporate testimony the core must be a good number of brothers and sisters in the church life who have a very profound personal life with the Lord.
