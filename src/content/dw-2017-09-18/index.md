_Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb._ _– Romans 4:19_

When God speaks to us, we should realize our inability to fulfill His desire through our own efforts. We are far from blameless. As we repent before the Lord, we feel both sweet and shameful. We thought we couldn’t believe, yet we still believed. This is the root of blamelessness. Abraham saw that he had nothing. It seemed hopeless when he considered his own body as good as dead, as well as the deadness of Sarah’s womb (Rom. 4:19). When God promised him a son through Sarah, it almost felt that God was making fun of him. He wanted to believe but he couldn’t. We sometimes have the same experience.
