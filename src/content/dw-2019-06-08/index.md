_“Draw me; we will run after thee.”_

_– Song of Songs 1:4, KJV_

  
Brothers and sisters, this principle remains the same until the end of this book. In these eight chapters, it is always “me” and “we.” We cannot experience these eight chapters alone; rather, we need the other virgins. That is the principle of “Draw me; we will run after you.”

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 26.
