Twenty years from now, the untrained person will not have become useful to the Lord. They may be captured by their careers or families, or may just come to nothing. They may become churchgoers with no real heart for what God is after. However, those who are willing to be trained by being faithful to what the Lord has committed to them will become those God is seeking after, those who are after His heart.
