_That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit._ _– John 3:6_

We were born again in our human spirit, and now we must worship God in spirit. No matter how good our mind is, we can never find God in the mental realm, because He is not in that realm. In John 4:24, Jesus is basically saying, “Do you want to know God? God is Spirit, so you must contact Him in the realm of the Spirit. Do you want to worship God? Then you must worship Him by using your human spirit.” This is not according to our natural thought.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; pages 72-73.
