_Abraham came near and said, “Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?...Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?”_ _– Genesis 18:23, 25_

How shallow our serving is compared to that of Abraham! Our serving may not even have the leading of God. Abraham went beyond this. He cooperated with God, and God cooperated with him. He was a true coworker of God. We need to pray to the Lord and ask for the grace so that we could grow to become His coworker. When God moves a little, we would know what He wants. We would be one with the Lord, and our capacity enlarged to the extent that we do what God does. Then we will fully enter into God’s burden. We know what God desires to do, and we co-labor with Him in His work.
