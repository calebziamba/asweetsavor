> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.

If your heart is hardened, you can be unresponsive to the feeling this life gives you. This doesn’t mean, however, that the self-existing life will terminate or disappear. After many, many years, He can still work within you.
