_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

We shouldn’t ask others to serve if they do not have the fresh appearing of the Lord. We should bring others into serving only according to how the Lord is working in them through His appearing. We need God’s mercy in this matter.
