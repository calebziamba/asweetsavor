_Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death._ _– Genesis 24:67_

When we see the Lord face to face, all the promises (Sarah) will be over, having been fulfilled. When this reality comes, the promise no longer remains. At that time, the Lord will bring us into the tent of promise and love us. We will be in the glory of God in complete union with the Lord. He will love us, and He will be comforted.
