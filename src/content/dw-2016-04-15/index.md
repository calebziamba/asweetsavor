_“I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.”_ _– Genesis 9:13_

God established a covenant with Noah and with all living creatures in which He bore all the responsibility. He would never again send a flood to destroy all flesh. This covenant with Noah was the first of a series of covenants that God made with man. He later made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (15:18; Exo. 2:24) and made a covenant with the people of Israel (Exo. 24:8).
