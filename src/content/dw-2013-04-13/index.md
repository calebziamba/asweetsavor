_After He had removed Saul, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, “I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do all My will.”_ _– Acts 13:22_

The Lord works with unworthy men for His testimony. According to our thought, God should not work with someone who fails Him, yet God will always use those who have a heart for Him, regardless how badly they fail Him. Out of David’s sin involving Bathsheba and Uriah, Solomon, the builder of the temple, was gained, and out of his sin of numbering the people, the site for the temple was gained.

After all these failures, we still have to appreciate David. His heart toward God allowed God to gain something for His purpose through him, even though his actions should have disqualified him. God was able to use David in spite of his failures because David was a man after God’s heart and sought to serve his generation as such a king.
