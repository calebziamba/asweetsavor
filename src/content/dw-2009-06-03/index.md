If you desire to be built up in God's house, you must also be one who serves in God's house. In other words, if you want to see God's house built up, become a serving one. Serve in His house as the Lord directs you, according to whatever matter or with those the Lord puts on your heart. Perhaps you should serve the children or the young people. If you are in college, perhaps you should serve your roommate until he or she receives the Lord Jesus. If you want to see the church built up, put on the priest's garment and serve in this corporate life of service known as the priesthood. The more you all serve together, the richer will be the Spirit's flow in the church life.

Those who serve in God's house are priests, who offer sacrifices to God for His satisfaction. When we serve as priests, we offer Christ to God for His satisfaction. Thus, when we serve in the priesthood, our focus is Christ. Yes, we may serve in many different capacities, but our corporate focus is Christ. Whether we serve in the service office, with the children, with the young people, or with the church as a whole, our focus is Christ. We only see Christ, and we only care for Christ. Brothers and sisters, when Christ becomes the unique focus of our serving, the divine flow will be present with us.
