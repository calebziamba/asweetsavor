> For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints. ... Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.
