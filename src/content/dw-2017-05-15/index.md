Being born again has three main results. The moment we believed in the Lord Jesus we received a new life, a new position, and the need for a new living. Of these three results, perhaps the one that is most neglected among Christians is the third, the need for a new living.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 69.
