When Paul told Timothy that the time of his departure had come (2 Tim 4:6), it seems he was peaceful to go. He had finished his course and had fought the good fight. He didn’t say, “I still need more time! I have seen so much. I can still be a help to the churches.” Paul did not hold onto the ministry God had given him. What he valued was the gaining of Christ.
