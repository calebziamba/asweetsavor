_So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And the Lord said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!” Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah. — First Samuel 16:12-13_

_Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God, who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee. — Second Corinthians 1:21-22_ The anointing David received is a picture of the New Testament believers’ experience of the Spirit (Acts 10:38; 2 Cor. 1:21). Therefore, we should seek to live and walk in the Spirit continually (Gal. 5:25). If we are faithful to follow the Lord who chose us, our experience of the anointing Spirit will become more substantial. The apostle John describes the assurance the Spirit brings: “By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit” (1 John 4:13).
