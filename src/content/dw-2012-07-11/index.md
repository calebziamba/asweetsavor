_Now therefore, know and consider what you should do, for evil is plotted against our master and against all his household; and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him. — First Samuel 25:17_ When Nabal’s wife, Abigail, heard how he had spoken to David’s men, she quickly realized she must do something to avert David’s wrath. She gathered together two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five sheep already prepared, five measures of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs and brought them to David. She did not tell Nabal anything, which was wise.
