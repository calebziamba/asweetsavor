> But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

> Josh. 24:15 (ESV)

People get married. People eat and drink. People have residences. People have cars. We have exactly the same things.  
Christians don’t have another kind of life, secluded away. We live among people; but we are very different. Why? Because of vision. It is because of vision that we say, “I am of Christ. My house: of Christ. My car: of Christ. My bank account: of Christ. More than that, I and my whole household are for nothing but Christ alone!” Isn’t this uncommon?

Our "uncommonness" allows us to follow the Lord in a clear way with nothing frustrating us.
