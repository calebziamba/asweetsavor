_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

_The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him._ _– Romans 8:1_6-17

The New Testament tells us that as believers, we are “Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to promise” (Gal. 3:29). We have received the Spirit as the pledge, or foretaste, of our inheritance (Eph. 1:14). Christ inherited all from the Father (John 16:15), and we are His fellow heirs (Rom. 8:16–17). The Spirit receives of the Son and reveals to us all that we have inherited in Christ (John 16:14).
