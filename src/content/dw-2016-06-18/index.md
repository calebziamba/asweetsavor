_The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord._ _– Romans 5:20–21_

Because we are now in the triune God, we are also standing in grace, which is really the triune God enjoyed by us.
