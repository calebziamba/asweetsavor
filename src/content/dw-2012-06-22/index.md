_And not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God. â€” Colossians 2:19_ When we live a life in resurrection with Christ, avoiding the worldly things and dropping the religious things, we will find ourselves spontaneously living a life in oneness. As we hold the Head, all the Body is knit together and grows with the growth of God (2:19). In such a living, the bountiful supply of Christ comes through the joints (the ministering brothers) and the sinews (the rest of the members).

This is a beautiful picture, for neither the joints nor the sinews attached to the joints can function independently of each other. How wonderful the Body life is! In this living, the members and the gifted ones function together to supply the Body.
