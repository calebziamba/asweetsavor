_“You are altogether beautiful, my darling,_ _And there is no blemish in you._ _Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:7-8_

The Lord expects us to come with Him from “the lions’ dens” and “the leopards’ mountains.” Peter described the devil as a roaring lion (1 Pet. 5:8). A lion is good at roaring, and a leopard is good at clawing, ripping, and destroying.

In Ephesians, Paul tells us that our battle is with an enemy who occupies heavenly places (6:12). Walking on the mountaintops and looking down from there inevitably bring us into an encounter with the lions’ dens and the leopards’ mountains. When Christ calls us to walk with Him in His ascension, we should not expect that everything will be easy for us. On the contrary, the lions and leopards will be closer than ever before. We will even have to learn to fight the enemy face to face.
