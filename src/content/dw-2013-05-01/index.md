_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith._ _– Philippians 3:8-9_

Purity is the highest virtue. Very few who love the Lord can love Him with purity and say, “The Lord is my first and best love.” Many love the Lord but with impure motives. When we deviate from giving the Lord the first place, we lose our purity.
