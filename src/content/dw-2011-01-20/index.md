_For Christ also did not please Himself, but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me." — Romans 15:3_ The mind of Christ is that He didn’t seek after the things that pleased Himself. On the contrary He bore our reproaches (Rom. 15:3).

We should not make ourselves a higher class. I have sometimes heard people say, “We are in the flow; our local church is in the flow.” There is nothing wrong with being in the flow, and actually, we ought to be in the flow. But to talk like this is to make ourselves a different class.

We do not know how to love the saints with the same love. Sometimes some brothers say, “I am one with the ministry.” If you are one with the ministry, I also am one with the ministry. But to be one with the ministry is not the issue. Christ is the issue.

To say that we are one with the ministry puts other brothers on the spot. Are they not one with the ministry? We are dividing the Body. We are dividing the Lord’s testimony. There is only oneness with Christ! Remember that one accord gives honor to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
