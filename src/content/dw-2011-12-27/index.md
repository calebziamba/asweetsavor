_But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better; yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith. — Philippians 1:23-25_

Paul’s word here reveals that his environment was in the Lord’s hands, not Caesar’s, for the Lord is the true Ruler over all things. Paul seemed confident that his appeal before Caesar Nero would achieve the desired effect, whether his release or his execution. The desire of this servant of the Lord was to continue upon this earth for the Philippians’ progress and joy of the faith (1:25).
