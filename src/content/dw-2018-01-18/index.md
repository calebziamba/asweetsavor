_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

After the servant testified of his master Abraham and of Isaac, Rebekah’s father and brother said, “Here is Rebekah before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son” (Gen. 24:51). The next morning, the servant wanted to leave with Rebekah right away (v. 54), but Rebekah’s mother and brother wanted her to remain for another ten days. When they asked Rebekah what she would do, she said she would go (v. 58).
