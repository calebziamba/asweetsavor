_And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved. — Acts 2:46-47_ The oneness the Lord prayed for when He was on the earth was realized and substantiated in the church in Jerusalem. They continued steadfastly in the apostles’ teaching and broke bread from house to house. They had the Lord’s table from house to house, not weekly but daily. They had a daily church life enjoying the riches of Christ. They had fellowship to gain more of Christ, and they praised God. Their praising God caused them to become fruitful. All the people around them appreciated them because they had the fragrance of joyfulness.
