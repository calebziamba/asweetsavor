> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> — Philippians 3:20 Darby

In this heavenly commonwealth, Christ is our power and energy (Eph. 1:19–23). He is our dynamo. In the church life, we can never truly be dead because Christ is the energizing One.
