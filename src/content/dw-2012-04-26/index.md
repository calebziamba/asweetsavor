_“Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.”_

_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.”_

_— Song of Songs 2:17-3:1_

To the surprise of the seeker, when the Lord retreated, she lost her inner feeling of His presence. Suddenly, all the feelings of sweetness and enjoyment were gone, and she was left alone there feeling empty and helpless.

Her response to this sudden change was to seek Him. The “Bed” in 3:1 refers to her previous experience and sweet fellowship with the Lord. A bed is the place where someone can lay down his work and enjoy rest. It depicts man’s self-satisfaction and self-sufficiency. If you are in your bed, you are not likely to be interested in rising up and going on.
