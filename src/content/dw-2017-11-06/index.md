_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

If we did not feel that we had a case, we would not grumble or dispute. Many of our complaints appear to be justified. The two million Israelites in the wilderness with Moses seemed to have good cause to murmur and complain. Even after water had gushed forth from the rock (Exo. 17; Num. 20), it was not comparable to the Nile.

Their arrival at Elim sounds quite pleasant, but what could seventy palm trees mean to two million people (Exo. 15:27)? At least in Egypt, they could have taken a bath and eaten a variety of tasty foods. Now they were in a dusty place, eating the same food day after day (Num. 11:6). Wouldn’t it seem reasonable to complain? I doubt that I would have been able to last for one month in the wilderness. Probably many of us would have soon headed back to Egypt.
