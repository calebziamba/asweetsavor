_"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away. For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. The flowers have already appeared in the land; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land. The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away!'" — Song of Songs 2:10-13_

Brothers and sisters, when you first got saved, you could weep as you thought about the Lord. After being revived in your spiritual life, you might have wept again as your love for Him was renewed. However, you don’t need to seek to return to those situations. That rain is over and gone. It is useless to wish for it or to pray for it. If you ask the Lord that you might experience it again, the Lord will reply, “Don’t ask to experience My mercy in this way again. I will not sympathize with you in this matter.”

Brothers and sisters, what you treasured, what was most sweet, what helped you before—all are gone. The Lord is now saying, “Rise up and come away. The rain is over and gone. I won’t water, nourish, and bless you in the way I did before. The rain that blessed you before has stopped now. It is over and gone. The matter you enjoyed before has come to an end.”
