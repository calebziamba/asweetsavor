_Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees and carpenters and stonemasons; and they built a house for David. And David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel._ _— Second Samuel 5:11-12_

When Hiram, unasked, sent all the materials and craftsmen to build David a palace, David perceived that the Lord had indeed set him to be king.

David was not presumptuous. It may seem obvious to us that God had indeed chosen David to be king after he was set as king over Judah and then over all Israel. David, however, was not like this; he always sought the Lord’s speaking and presence. Therefore, he needed confirmation that what had happened was of the Lord and not merely of man, and Hiram’s act provided this.
