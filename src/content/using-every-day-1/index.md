> \[The Lord Jesus Christ\] will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.
> 
> â€“ Philippians 3:21

What a blessing it is to live a long life! Every day is given to us that we might use it to be further renewed, sanctified, transformed, and conformed. The degree that we are conformed in time will determine the degree we are glorified in eternity. Therefore, use every day to gain more of Christ.
