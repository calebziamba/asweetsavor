_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

Because Epaphroditus carried out practical things spiritually, he was able to be a minister to Paul’s need. Each of us should aspire to this. We may not be noticeably talented or gifted, but eventually we should each become ministers like Epaphroditus. We may not become ministers to some great apostle’s need, but we should be able to meet the church’s need. If we are ushers, we can become ministers to meet the church’s need by caring for those whom we usher. If we are in charge of parking, we should carry out our service spiritually.

In the Old Testament, there were two types of service to God in the tabernacle—the practical service of the Levites (Num. 1:50–51), and the more spiritual service of the priests (Exo. 28:41, 43). In the New Testament age, however, every believer is a priest (1 Pet. 2:9). Even if we are handling what seems to be Levitical work, we must carry it out in a priestly way. We must carry out practical things spiritually.
