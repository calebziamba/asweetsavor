This sharing is taken from the third hymns session of the January 2009 [Jesus Lovers' Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/)

In this session on hymns brother Titus spends time first to go over one of his own hymns (Experience of Love, Songs & Hymns of Life #248) on how the Lord draws us to himself when we are weak. He then covers A.B. Simpson’s hymn, [“O Lord, Breathe Thy Spirit on Me”](https://www.hymnal.net/en/hymn/h/255) (Songs & Hymns of Life #179)
