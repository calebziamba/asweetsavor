Concerning our new position in Christ, we need to see that we have become God’s inheritance, as described in Ephesians 1:11. According to many translations, this verse is speaking of the inheritance we have in Christ. However, in some versions we see that it also refers to the fact that we have become God’s inheritance. For example, in the ASV, Ephesians 1:11 says,

_In Him we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will._
