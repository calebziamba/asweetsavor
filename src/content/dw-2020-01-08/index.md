_“__Behold, I am with you and will keep you  
wherever you go, and will bring you back  
to this land; for I will not leave you until  
I have done what I have promised you”  
– Genesis 32:28  
_

We all have character flaws and weaknesses. We are a disappointment not only to others but even to ourselves. Only God doesn’t give up on us. God sees our flaws, yet He still loves us and grants us His promise, blessing, and presence. When He disciplines us, He also empowers us. This is why Christians can even be joyful in the midst of trials. We are able to stand because we have His promise, blessing, and presence. Even in difficult environments, when we walk on the way of God, we experience these three all the time.
