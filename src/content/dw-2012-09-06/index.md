_King Solomon made for himself a palanquin_ _From the timber of Lebanon._ _He made its posts of silver,_ _Its bottom of gold_ _And its seat of purple fabric,_ _With its interior lovingly fitted out_ _By the daughters of Jerusalem._ _— Song of Songs 3:9-10_

In order to be the Lord’s palanquin, we need to experience the Lord’s redemption, represented by the silver.  Without the silver, there is no palanquin. If our thoughts are filled with low things, then we cannot be the Lord’s palanquin. If we are lazy, we cannot be the Lord’s palanquin. If we have an uncontrollable temper, we cannot be the palanquin. Our thoughts, our will, and our character need to experience being redeemed. When we truly experience the Lord’s redemption, we will be able to bear Christ to others.
