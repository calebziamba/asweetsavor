We might think that the Lord should have judged David for taking multiple wives and capturing idols (2 Sam. 5:13, 21), but the Lord instead seemed quite happy with David. In fact, when David inquired about attacking the Philistines, the Lord proposed that David and He fight them together (2 Sam. 5:23–25). The Lord said, “When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall advance quickly. For then the Lord will go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines” (v. 24). Together, David and the Lord defeated the Philistines.
