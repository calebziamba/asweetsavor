> ...that I may gain Christ and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8b-9

May we have a strong cry within, “Lord, I want to be found in You! I want to be found in Your accomplished work, Your present work, and in You Yourself.” May we all find rest in Him and yet be absolute for His desire!

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians)_ by Titus Chu, pages 192-193
