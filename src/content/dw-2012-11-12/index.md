"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

_He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets._ _— Matthew 12:19_

The principle of the Lord Jesus’ living was the principle of the seed. This included His teaching, His working and laboring, and His operation. With Christ there was a living which is very different from our living in the church life.

One verse that describes His living is Matt. 12:19, which is a quotation from Isaiah: “He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.” This shows us that the Lord’s living was a living without strife, and without crying out.
