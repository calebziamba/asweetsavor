_I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints. — Ephesians 1:18_

How glorious the Lord’s inheritance is! Other than the Lord Himself, nothing can match it for glory.

Even the glory of kings, queens, and presidents cannot compare to the riches of the glory the Lord is gaining in His believers. God is a God of glory (Acts 7:2), and what He desires is His glorious inheritance in the saints. When we see the church, we see God’s workmanship, God’s masterpiece (Eph. 2:10). The church is filled with the riches of God’s glory.
