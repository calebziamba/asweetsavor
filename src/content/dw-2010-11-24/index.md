_I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. â€”Romans 12:1_ We must see that one accord comes from one sacrifice. Without one sacrifice there cannot be the one accord. One accord is not uniformity. One accord is not imposition. One accord is not to have a common goal. One accord is not all bearing the same interest. One accord is not all being of the same race, language, or age. One accord is divine, organic, and in life.
