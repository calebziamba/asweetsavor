The fact that we were formerly in death, but are now in life, means that we are now in resurrection. Ephesians 2:4â€“6 says,

_God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus._
