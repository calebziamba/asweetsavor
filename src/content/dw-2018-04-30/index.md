Before we enter into the apostle Paul’s epistle to the Romans, we must have a general understanding of the whole letter. Its content consists of seven key items:

It was written according to God’s will, which is the gospel of God. It is centered upon the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord. It is structured mainly around salvation, life, and building. It reveals to us God’s will, His economy, and His marvelous work in us. It unveils our triune God’s complete work of salvation, a spiritual reality that is the base of all of Paul’s epistles. It teaches us what the healthy growth of life in a Christian looks like. It testifies of the universal body of Christ, which is manifested in local churches.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 3.
