_“How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!_ _How much better is your love than wine,_ _And the fragrance of your oils Than all kinds of spices!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:10_

Are we the ones who prompt the Lord to exclaim, “How beautiful is your love!”? Perhaps there is a good meeting, after which everyone is excited, saying, “How rich was the presence of the Lord! Every testimony was so prevailing!” The Lord’s response might be, “This is because of My love, which, as you say, is better than wine. But what about your love for Me?” What the Lord treasures is our love.
