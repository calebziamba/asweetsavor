_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

Due to his interaction with God over many years, Abraham was confident of God’s supply and desire. However, when God told him that He is the all-bountiful God before whom he should walk and be blameless, Abraham found it hard to believe that he could be blameless. Yet God’s words made him hopeful.
