_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

To be a Christian is to be in Christ Jesus, but as we grow in the Christian life, we will eventually become those who are of Christ Jesus. “In” is a matter of position, while “of” is a matter of possession. Once we are born again, we have the status and position of being in Christ Jesus. Then, as we grow in life through the process of salvation, we become those who are of Christ Jesus—we belong to the Lord and serve Him practically.
