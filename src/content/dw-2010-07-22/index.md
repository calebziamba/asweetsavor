_Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven." — Exodus 17:14_ Joshua may have defeated the Amalekites outwardly, but a greater Amalek still lurked within, coveting the glory of the victory the Lord had given them. We like to think that we are the reason God blesses us. As soon as God blesses us, our flesh rises up to rob God of His glory. Outwardly we may say, “We have been blessed, and it is all the Lord’s mercy,” but inwardly something is already attempting to supplant the work of the Spirit. Therefore, we need to be reminded that it is the Lord who is the Victor, not we ourselves.
