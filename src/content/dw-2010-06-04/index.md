_Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. — Exodus 19:5-6

But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. — First Peter 2:9_

God raised up Israel to be a holy nation upon the earth. Since only God is holy, to be a holy nation is to be a testimony of God. He has raised us up to be His testimony as well. How good it is if people come to our gatherings and see that God is among us!
