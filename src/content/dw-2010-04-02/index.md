_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

We should prepare ourselves. If we truly want to be enlarged then we must tell the Lord, “Lord, I am ready. Put Your hand on me. Plow over my back. I know that when You plow, furrows will be cut. Then Your life can grow.”

If we are so “perfect,” so complete and so preserved, if we are still so much in ourselves, then how can the Lord grow in us? We must allow the Lord to deal with our person through the environment He has arranged for us. The Lord will plow over our back at the right time and in the right place so that furrows will be produced and abundant life can come forth. This is what we need for our enlargement.
