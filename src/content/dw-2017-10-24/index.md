_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

If we truly fear God, we are blessed. If we don’t fear Him, we haven’t yet gained Him. Our gaining of God is manifested in four ways: we know ourselves, we are one with God to accomplish His desire, we overcome our weakness in faith, and we fear God to the uttermost.
