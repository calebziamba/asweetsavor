> Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.” This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, “Follow Me.”
> 
> John 21:18–19

If you were to ask me, “I have seen a vision and a revelation. What kind of life shall I live?” I would say, check these two things: first, are you young, or are you quite mature? If you’re young, then rise up. Drive your car to the neighboring town and preach the gospel. Rise up, walk around your neighborhood and talk to your neighbors about the gospel. I do something, I gird myself for the testimony, to fulfill what I have seen. According to what? According to what I feel that the Lord has led me to do, until one day, by the Lord’s mercy, you grow.
