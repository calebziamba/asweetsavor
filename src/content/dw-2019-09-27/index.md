_Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob - Genesis 25:26_

A natural man has no personal relationship with God. Jacob didn’t have a relationship with God until he wrestled with him at Peniel. He had listened to stories of how his grandfather left Ur and Haran and came to Shechem, Bethel, and Hebron. He knew how God had appeared to both his father and grandfather and had blessed them. He must have heard many stories which caused him to value the birthright and the blessings. He knew a lot, but he himself had no relationship with God. God was God and Jacob was Jacob.
