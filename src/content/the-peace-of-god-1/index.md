> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
> 
> – Philippians 4:7 (ESV)

As we pray in the midst of all that concerns us, peace comes. This peace is not just any peace. It is the peace of God which is far beyond our understanding. If we were offered a job promotion that would take us far away from the church we have been serving, we may be torn between whether to take the offer for the sake of our family or to turn it down for the sake of the church. This inner conflict causes us to lose our inner peace. As we pray, however, our soul is brought back to a peaceful state, even before we know the Lord’s mind in this matter. The peace that goes beyond our comprehension has come.
