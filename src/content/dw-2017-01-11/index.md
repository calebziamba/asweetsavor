_You are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household._ _– Ephesians 2:19_

Since we are vessels of God, God’s temple, members of the body of Christ, and fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, how could we choose to be isolated or to remain by ourselves? How could we try to have an individualistic Christian life? We must realize that our Christian life is a corporate matter, in which we are the members of God’s household, His very family.
