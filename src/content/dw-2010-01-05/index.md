_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine.” — Song of Songs 1:1-2_

The beginning is so good: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!” But it is not followed by, “For you yourself are better than wine.” Instead it is followed by, “For your love is better than wine.” At this stage we are not deeply touching the Lord Himself. We are only touching His love. When we are weak and ask for forgiveness, the Lord tells us, “I love you. I forgive you.” Since we have a very limited capacity at this point, the Lord can only allow us to touch His love. We still do not know how rich He is. At this stage we have yet to discover the riches of His person.

If we want to enjoy the Lord Himself, we need to pay a price to spend time before the Lord. How much we see of Him depends on our capacity. The vision and experiences we can receive depend on our measure of life. The more we grow, the more He will show us who He is. He is boundless. We need to have a yearning for more growth in life. Eventually, we will find out we are able to experience the Lord Himself.
