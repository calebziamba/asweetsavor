> ...that I may gain Christ and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8b-9

According to Paul, if we have our own righteousness, we cannot be found in Christ. This simply is not our thought. Our thought is if we lack righteousness, we need to spend time to mourn our poor situation. However, Paul indicated that even though there is nothing good in us, we can be found in Christ by means of the righteousness which is based on faith. It is not our own righteousness but our faith in Christ that causes us to be found in Him. Because we have faith in Christâ€™s redemptive work, we have the righteousness of God. Thus, we are found in Christ.
