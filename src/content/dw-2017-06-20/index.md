_You are My friends if you do what I command you._ _– John 15:14_

Who is Christ? He is our Friend. This means that we can be so open with Him. When we come to the Lord, we can be honest and genuine about our situation. We don’t have to hide things from Him, and we don’t have to pretend. We can be completely open with Him, because He is our Friend. We can tell Him everything.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 76.
