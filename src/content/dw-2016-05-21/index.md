_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves. Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others._ _— Philippians 2:3-4_

_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _— First Corinthians 3:6_

When we consider the believers around us one by one, we should thank the Lord for each one’s portion, growth, and manifestation. The Lord is working in each of them. One may be energetic and able to lead, and another may be so sweet. They are each members of the body of Christ.
