_And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. — John 17:22-23_ This refers to being perfected until a testimony is produced. Perfecting is related to the matter of life, that is, one’s life abilities or talents. Every life has its own talent or ability. This life needs perfecting. No one would say, “Oh, life will grow by itself.”

Many of the young adults among us have grown up from when we knew them as children. We often embarrass them when we remind them of how we cradled them in our arms and played with them when they were young. Yet, today we see all these young ladies so well dressed with beautiful hair. This is because in the process of growth there was a living, and out of this living a testimony was produced.

So when the Lord Jesus prayed for us, He did so in life. And this life becomes the element to produce the oneness among us. When the world would degrade us, we have a life and a living that produces another testimony. We are not following the trends of the age, nor are we creating a trend of our own. We are enjoying the oneness that God now has with us and that we have with each other. Furthermore, we are allowing our talents or innate abilities to be perfected or developed by the Lord.
