_After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ attendant,  saying: “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.” — Joshua 1:1-3_

Before Moses died, Joshua was appointed by God to serve in his place (Num. 27: 12–23; Deut. 31:7). Joshua, however, continued as Moses’ attendant until Moses died. After he was taken, God told Joshua, “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them” (Josh. 1:2).
