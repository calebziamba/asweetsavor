_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

The fear of not partaking of this salvation will drive us to work it out. How great a salvation we need just to be saved in the way we style our hair! We need to be saved in the way we love others and in the way we serve the Lord. The working out of this salvation is to be experienced in every aspect of our lives, yet we exclude the Lord in so many areas. This is what we must fear.
