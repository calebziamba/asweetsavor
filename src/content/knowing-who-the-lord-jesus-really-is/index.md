This message is the first given during the [Jesus Lovers' Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/) held on the weekend of January 16-18, 2009

If we are to love God, we surely must know who He is. The apostle John has three crucial statements that speak of what God is in Himself, telling us that God is Spirit (John 4:24), Light (1 John 1:5), and love (1 John 4:8, 16).

In addition, in this message we also consider briefly the three ministries of Peter, Paul, and John. Peter’s ministry was one of revival and Paul’s ministry stressed the truth, while John’s ministry stressed the reality of Christ; that is, how real is Christ to you?
