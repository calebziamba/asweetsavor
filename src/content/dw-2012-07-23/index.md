_So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping inside the circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people were lying around him. — First Samuel 26:7_

Saul began again to pursue David. He and his three thousand men set up camp in Ziph. David came right into Saul’s camp at night with Abishai, one of his men. They found that the Lord had caused a deep sleep to fall upon Saul and those around him (1 Sam. 26:5–7, 12).

Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore, please, let me strike him at once with the spear, right to the earth” (v. 8).
