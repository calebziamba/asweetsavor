_“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2, KJV_

Our Christian experience begins with a longing: “Let Him kiss me!” This longing is the beginning of our love toward the Lord. What a beginning! It does not originate from us, but from the Lord. Perhaps after we were saved we went to some meetings but lived a religious life. However, when we finally turn from our religious living there will appear a “Him” who causes us to cry, “Let Him! Let Him!” Now we are touching “the Him” in the universe.
