_Now the young man Samuel was ministering to the Lord under Eli. And the word of the Lord was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision. — First Samuel 3:1_ Samuel was serving as a priest—not on his own, but rather under a high priest whose eyesight was no longer clear. It was under these conditions, however, that the Lord spoke to him.
