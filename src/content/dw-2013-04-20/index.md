_I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?_ _– Second Corinthians 12:15_

The book of 2 Corinthians tells us of another problem. The believers in Corinth criticized and belittled Paul, who labored among them, poured himself out for them, and did everything for their spiritual health. It is possible to say, “I belong to Christ,” and at the same time criticize those who labor for our growth in the Lord.

We need to be balanced. We don’t exalt any of the Lord’s servants by being of them, but we also don’t belittle or despise them.
