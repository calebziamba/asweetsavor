A good personality is the result of growth in life as well as exercise. Life is wonderful, especially the divine life. If God’s life grows in you properly, it will produce many virtues in the process. The divine virtues will naturally be constituted in you and become your personality. We need the Lord’s mercy, and we need to ask Him to grow in us. He not only lives in us but also conforms and transforms our life. The transformation of life will result in a personality that is useful to the Lord.
