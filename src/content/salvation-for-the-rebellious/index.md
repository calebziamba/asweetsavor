> You have ascended on high, You have led captive Your captives; You have received gifts among men, Even among the rebellious also, that the LORD God may dwell there.
> 
> Psalm 68:18

Everyone is a rebellious one. With all the rebellious ones, God says, "No, I would still like to be a man. Why? Only so that I can be your Savior. Only so I can accomplish My desire. Only so I can become the Exalted Lord, the Exalted One, with humanity."
