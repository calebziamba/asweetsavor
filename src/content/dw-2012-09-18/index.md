_Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn ewes Which have come up from their washing, All of which bear twins, And not one among them has lost her young. — Song of Songs 4:2_

The seeker has a whole “flock” of teeth. Teeth refer to one’s ability to receive, because they convey the thought of chewing on food. The Lord’s seeker has a flock of teeth, so her ability to receive something is notable. She knows how to enjoy eating and fully receive food.

This shows we should be able to receive help from any believer, even a newly saved one. Anything that is fresh in life and in the Spirit should become our food. The matured saints are those whose teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes. In other words, their enjoyment before the Lord and in the church life is pure and thorough.
