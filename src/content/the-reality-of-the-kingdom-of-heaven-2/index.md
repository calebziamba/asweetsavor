_The kingdom of heaven is at hand_ means “I am right here for you to repent.” The kingdom of heaven was introduced by John the Baptist. When John the Baptist preached, he knew who Christ was. He knew that the kingdom of heaven is with Christ and that Christ is the kingdom of heaven. So when John began his ministry he boldly declared, “Repent! For the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Then Jesus continued with the same message. You should say, “Lord Jesus, You are at hand. You are the kingdom of heaven, and I as a man should repent. When I repent, I can be one with you.”
