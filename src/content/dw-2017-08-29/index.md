_“I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.”_ _– Revelation 3:15–16_

If a church is growing in life and new ones are coming, there will be many troubles. We will need to spend much time with these new ones. This kind of church life grants us many experiences of the furnace and the torch. If our church life is merely a meeting life, we have become lukewarm and are finished. The experience of both the torch and the furnace cause our Christian life to advance. In appearance we seem to have ups and downs; in reality we are advancing all the time. If we constantly have the experience of the furnace and the torch, we are useful in the hands of the Lord.
