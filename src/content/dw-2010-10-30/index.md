_O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; Nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me. — Psalm 131:1_

Not only do we no longer consider ourselves so high, but we no longer look for great things in which to participate. Suppose the Lord is moving dramatically in another country. This is a great matter, much greater than our local situation. If we are young in the Lord then once we hear about it we will immediately respond, “I am ready to go!” But after we see who we are in the Lord’s light, then we are not so quick to respond. Instead we will pray and be restful. We can trust that the Lord will make it known to us if He wants us to go. When we receive the Lord’s shining we become very careful. Because we see who we are, we do not trust ourselves. We learn not to “go about in things too great or too wondrous.” We allow the Lord to lead us if we should be involved in something great that He is doing.
