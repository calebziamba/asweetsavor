_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _â€”Philippians 2:3_

When a new president takes office, he sails in on his victory. He has overcome many obstacles to reach that office. Once the reality of his new responsibilities sets in, however, his attitude changes, his relationship with others changes, and the way he carries his commitment changes. This is because he has come to understand his inadequacy. It is not an easy lesson.
