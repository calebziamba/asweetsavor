_That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._ _– Ephesians 1:18_

How can we say that we are in the heavenlies with Christ, and are becoming God’s masterpiece? Because the Bible says so! We believe in the word of God and not in our small failures and defeats. We are born again, and God has transferred us into His kingdom.

May the Lord grant us the experience and enjoyment of all the riches of our wonderful new position!
