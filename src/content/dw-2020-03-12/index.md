_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,  
set apart for the gospel of God Which He promised beforehand  
through His prophets in the holy Scriptures"  
\-Romans 1:1-2  
_

Contrary to many people’s thought, the Old Testament is full of gospel messages that contain the promise of Christ. For example, immediately after man fell, God promised that the seed of a  woman, Christ, would bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15). This was the promise of the gospel to Adam! In Noah’s age, God commanded Noah to prepare and build an ark. This ark eventually brought his whole household and all the living creatures on Earth safely through the floodwaters. In typology, the ark is Christ. This was the gospel promised in Noah’s time.
