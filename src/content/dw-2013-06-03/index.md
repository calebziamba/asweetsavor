Some brothers are very zealous. They are zealous to the extent that whoever they serve knows nothing about life and dies. This kind of brother is a workaholic and lusts after work.

One brother was going to migrate to another country. He was still young. If I were the serving one, I would bless him, pray with him, and tell him to be cautious and not to do anything without Christ. But I heard that the brother who was caring for him told him, “This is an important step for you. Whether you will be manifested or successful among the churches depends on it. Therefore, when you go to that country, you must quickly build something up.”

I cannot tell you how sad I was when I heard this. What kind of intention did this serving one have? What kind of mind was this? What kind of personality was this? I served those brothers, and I never taught them any of this. Ninety percent of my teaching was to warn them and admonish them. Less than ten percent was to tell them what to do. But eventually they still picked up the wrong concept, for their desire was to be successful in the church and devoted to the work. They cared for nothing but the work. They could think of nothing but gaining the praise of the leading brothers. Their personality was dominated by religious zeal.
