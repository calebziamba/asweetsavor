## "Your Christian life is a matter of vision."

What is your vision? What do you see? To most Christians, this matter usually seems very mystical. However, we may be surprised to hear that in the New Testament, visions are often related to practical matters. People see a vision, they change. People see a vision, they have a new pattern of living. People see a vision, they have a new pattern of living. People see a vision, they have a new beginning. In every vision are many revelations, each one able to strengthen the receivers, help them go on, and give them clear direction.

In the first volume of this series, "Visions and Revelations," Titus Chu considers the visions God gave surrounding the birth of Jesus and the beginning of His ministry. At that time, the age of Law was turning to the age of grace, and the visions God gave focused people on His Son and brought them into a realization of what He really desires. By considering the vision of famous characters like Joseph, Mary, Zacharias, the shepherds, the wise men, and John the Baptist, we too can see what they saw and experience what they experienced. Just as these characters were challenged and called, this volume of messages challenges us to leave our old ways, our old habits, and our old patterns, and calls us to be brought into something new and fresh of God's heart through visions and revelations.

The second volume of the series focuses on the apostle Peter and his experiences in the Gospels, inviting us to growth healthily following his pattern. Like Peter, we can be vitalized through the Father's revelation of Jesus as "the Christ, the Son of the living God." With Peter, we can join in Christ's heart's desire as we hear His revelation of the church. This church is not static; it is being built up, it is standing against the gates of Hades, and its members are opening doors for the kingdom of heaven around the world! And next to Peter on the Mount of Transfiguration, we can even see with amazement the vision of Jesus as God manifested in the flesh in glory.

Like us, Peter was a common man, emotional and changeable. But the visions given to him by the Father and the Lord Jesus changed him, vitalized him, and transformed him into someone useful for the Lord's work. May we join Peter as receivers and followers of such wonderful visions and revelations.
