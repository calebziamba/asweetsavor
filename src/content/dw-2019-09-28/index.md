_Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob - Genesis 25:26_

Sometimes we may fall to the same situation without knowing it. We have a lot of spiritual knowledge yet lack a personal relationship with God. We may have a lot of spiritual activities but these may replace God. Some are so concerned with their church’s attendance that this replaces God. Some are so consumed with the young people’s work that they have no concern for God. He is not as important as their work. O how we need the Lord’s mercy!

Jacob had no personal relationship with God. He liked to have spiritual things, but he didn’t pursue God. His experience with God was limited. We also may be zealous Jacobs. We may pray eloquently but only have the joy of praying without seeing God. We may live in a religious realm, loving Christian work, reading the Bible, and preaching the gospel, yet all the while be far away from God.
