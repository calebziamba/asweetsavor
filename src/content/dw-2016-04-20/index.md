_“I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.”_ _– Genesis 9:13_

In our experience, we are not in the age of Adam but in the age of God’s covenant with Noah. God doesn’t drive us away but invites us to come to Himself. Even though Israel crucified the Lord Jesus, the Bible still says, “All Israel will be saved” (Rom. 11:26).

As in the covenant God made with Noah, God’s demand today is only on Himself and He bears all the responsibility. He has no expectation toward us. He doesn’t ask us to work for Him but carries out His work Himself. Praise the Lord! This is truly a good tiding.
