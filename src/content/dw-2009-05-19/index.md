_Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh. â€” Second Corinthians 3:3_ By being born again we have become the letters of Christ. This means that the Lord is writing on us all the time. The apostle Paul said this clearly (2 Cor. 3:3).

Previously, we have seen that our stony hearts were replaced with hearts of flesh. After being born again, we experience the Lord writing on our hearts of flesh with the Spirit of the living God. The longer we follow the Lord, the more time He has to write on us. However, it is possible to be born again and yet have very little writing to be read. We are letters of Christ, but we must allow the Lord to write on us. For example, if we desire someone else to get saved, and we pray for them, then the Lord is writing on us. There is something that can be read, both by the Lord and by the brothers and sisters.
