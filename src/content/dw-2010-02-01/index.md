It is not a small matter to have a heart that is equipped, for we only have one heart. Therefore if it is occupied with one thing, it is hard for something else to gain ground in it.

Thirty years ago, the recovery was still somewhat new in America. At that time the saints were absolute. As time passed, the young people got married and had children, and their minds naturally became occupied with their children. Because of increased financial burdens, many began to consider how to gain promotions or raises. Their mind became focused on finances. Therefore, I often tell others that it is good to be a full-timer, for one who is full-time is less likely to think about such things.
