_But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. These are the records of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God._ _– Genesis 6:5-6_

Noah walked with God—he walked in life. Because of this, he found favor in the Lord’s eyes. The great things in God’s plan are always generated from life.
