Salvation is for life, and life is for the building of the body of Christ, which is expressed through local churches. The reality of the building of the body of Christ is experienced in local churches (see Rom. 12–16).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 10.
