_Then it happened as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart._ _— Second Samuel 6:16_

Michal, David’s first wife and the daughter of Saul, looked out of her window and wondered, “Who is that crazy person down there dancing?” Perhaps someone told her, “That’s your husband, David.”

Michal mocked David and said to him, “How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants, as one of the base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!” (2 Sam. 6:20). I think she meant that he had gone about without his kingly garments on. To her, when he walked about, he should have been recognizable as the king, not just one of the many priests.
