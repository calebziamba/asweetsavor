Some are smooth and slick. I somewhat admire this kind of person. If someone wants to be smooth and slick, he needs to put a lot of effort into it. I don’t care to be such a one, and I dare not be this kind of person. I don’t want this because being smooth is not being spiritual. I dare not be such a person because it wastes my mind. This kind of person will eventually say whatever pleases others and will become full of hypocrisy.
