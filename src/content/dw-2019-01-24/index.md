_So \[Isaac\] built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.  
__– Genesis 26:25_

As soon as we begin to love the Lord, we should pray that we would live a life of the tent. When people ask about our future plans, we should only answer, “I don’t know.” If the Lord says go, we are willing to go. If He says stay, we are willing to stay. If He says to go abroad, we are willing to do so. As those serving the Lord, we should never become settled.
