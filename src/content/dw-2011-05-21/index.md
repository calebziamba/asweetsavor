_Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And Saul said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” — First Samuel 28:11_

_“The Lord has departed from you and has become your enemy....The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David” — First Samuel 28:16–17_

Once we get involved with religion, we have no idea how far it will eventually take us from God. This is why I refuse to compromise when I see anything coming in that might become a substitute for Christ, regardless how good or necessary it may seem. Though it be called a “top truth,” a “top ministry,” or even a “top oneness,” if the believers are not brought to Christ Himself, it is vanity.

Anything that is apart from Christ Himself cannot result in what is according to God’s heart. The only thing that will be produced out of such things is another denomination.
