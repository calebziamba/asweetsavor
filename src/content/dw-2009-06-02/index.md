_I rejoiced when they said to me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah! Our feet are standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem. — Psalm 122:1-2_

Jerusalem is a city that stands for God as His testimony. Formerly we stood outside of this city, meaning we were outside of God's testimony. We may have seen through the world and we may have seen who the Lord was, but we still didn't fully see what the Lord Himself was doing. Neither did we have any experience of His testimony.

But then some saints told us to come to a church meeting, or a conference, or a gathering of a few saints. They said to us, “Let us go and enjoy the Lord in His house together!” Then we began to enjoy and experience the church life. Once we enjoyed the church life, a separation occurred. Our feet were not only being kept from the world, as in Psalm 121. Now our feet were in Jerusalem. “Our feet are standing within your gates, O Jerusalem!” Formerly we were out, but now we were in! Formerly we had nothing to do with the church life, but now we came into the church life!

Once we came into the church life, our feet were standing within the gates of Jerusalem. This means that we had truly left the world. We dropped the world and wanted nothing more to do with it. From that point on, we belonged to the Lord. We were now for the church life.
