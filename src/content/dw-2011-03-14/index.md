_"He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:4_ The first section of Song of Songs is characterized by love. It begins, “Your love is better than wine” (1:2). It continues with being brought into his chambers and extolling the king’s love more than wine (1:4). However, in this section we are caught primarily by the feeling of love, but not yet the reality of love.
