_“For why should I be like one who veils herself_ _Beside the flocks of your companions?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

If we are in a normal spiritual condition before God, we will not easily be occupied and trapped with work. Instead, we will spend our time seeking the Lord. However, if we are caught by our work, we will not be able to go on with Him and grow properly. Only when we focus solely on the Lord are we able to grow in a normal way.
