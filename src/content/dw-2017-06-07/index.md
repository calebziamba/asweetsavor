_God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth._ _– John 4:24_

Have we ever realized that we can enjoy the living Christ? Many Christians who are genuinely born again miss this enjoyment. They may enjoy God’s care for them or God’s blessing upon them, but few can say, “I enjoy the presence of a living person. Christ Himself is my enjoyment.” We must see that Christ is a living person for us to enjoy! We are not just enjoying an emotion or a kind of excitement. We are enjoying an actual person—Christ Himself.
