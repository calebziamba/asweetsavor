_“Let the young men now arise and compete.”_...

_So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side_....__

_But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men, so that three hundred and sixty men died._ _— 2 Samuel 2:14, 15-16, 31_

Asahel was no match for Abner, who killed him with the back end of his spear. Most that died that day, however, were of Abner’s army. Three hundred sixty of his men died, while only twenty of Joab’s men were killed, including Asahel. Joab afterward killed Abner and was marked by David because of it (2 Sam. 3:27–28, 39).
