_“Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? Where do you make it lie down at noon?” —Song of Songs 1:7_ Here she has a prayer, “Lord, please tell me where You feed the flock. The brothers have asked me to serve in some matter, but I don’t feel right about it. I want to labor according to my burden, but the brothers don’t agree. Oh, Lord, where do You feed the flock?”

On the one hand, she has her commission from the Lord. On the other hand, she is still focused upon her relationship with the Lord. Our vineyard represents what the Lord has committed to us. We will find that although we may labor much in tending our vineyard, our labor will not satisfy us and will not produce what God desires, for our labor will be something from ourselves, and not from God. Such a realization will cause us to pray such a prayer, asking the Lord to show us His work.

If we do not have such a relationship with the Lord, we will not come to this point, for we will not have the sense that there is any problem as we attempt to carry out what concerns us in the Christian life. But if we truly love the Lord, we will ask, “Tell me, You whom my soul loves, where do You feed Your flock?”
