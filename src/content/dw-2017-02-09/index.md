_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

_Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind._ _—Philippians 2:2_

Paul helped the Philippians by encouraging them to be of the same mind and united in spirit (Phil. 2:2). This was only possible by their letting the mind of Christ be in them (v. 5).

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ,”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 113.
