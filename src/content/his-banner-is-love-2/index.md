> His banner over me is love
> 
> \- Song of Songs 2:4

Brothers and sisters, when we realize that we are overshadowed by the Lord’s banner of love we will become very restful. We may have tears, but they will be the tears of joy. We can go on without fear, because we know that the Lord’s love sustains us to go through all the things that He has arranged for us.
