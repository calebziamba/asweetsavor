Romans is such a wonderful book! It was written according to God’s will, which is the gospel of God. It is centered on Christ. It is structured around salvation, life, and building. It reveals God’s work in us according to His will and economy. It unveils His complete work of salvation. It teaches us what to expect as we grow in the divine life. And it testifies of the universal body of Christ, which is manifested in local churches. Praise the Lord for such a foundational book in the New Testament!
