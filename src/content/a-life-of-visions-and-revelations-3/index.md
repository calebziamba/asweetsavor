> Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.” This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, “Follow Me.”
> 
> John 21:18–19

You see a vision. So, when you are young, you realize your life is for serving Him desperately! Serving in Him with all your life, with all your strength, doing everything to satisfy Christ. But it is according to what you feel is right. When you are old, you’ll find all kinds of needs which the Lord allows to happen. So, you have to stretch out your hand and let the church’s needs bind you; to let the saint’s needs bind you; to let a specific need bind you. So you are under a kind of bondage, yet it is so healthy because that makes you a protector, a life giver, a stability, a source, and a strength for the church life, for the saints, and for all what may happen when God operates.
