_That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. — Philippians 3:10_

Paul’s letter to the church in Philippi was different from his other epistles. Philippians was not written because the believers were confronting any major issues or problems. Paul wrote to these saints simply because the church there satisfied the Lord and made Paul happy.

In this sense, Paul’s writing to this church is very pure. There is nothing to divert the apostle from his basic message. Therefore, this book is one of the best for any who wish to grasp the secret of the Christian life. Whoever dives into these four chapters will find out how to be a joyful, energized, pursuing, laboring, fighting, and one-with-the-Lord Christian.
