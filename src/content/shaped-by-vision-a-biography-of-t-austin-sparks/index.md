This biography of Theodore Austin-Sparks covers his life from childhood to the end of his ministry. It includes many excerpts from his bi-monthly journal, "A Witness and a Testimony" and also includes short summaries of 28 books he published throughout his ministry.

The ministry of T. Austin-Sparks portrays a profound picture of Christ and of God's eternal purpose to head up all things in Christ. On the side of personal experience, his ministry opens the door to a deep inward work of the cross of Christ, and inward knowing of the Spirit, and an inward working of God's divine life. He portrays this experience in the context of a local assembly and emphasizes that the church, not merely individual believers, is the unique instrument through which God will gain His eternal goal.
