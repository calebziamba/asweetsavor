It has been said before that if the New Testament is like a ring, then Romans is like the diamond atop the ring. It is a precious book, and even more so in relation to Paul’s other epistles. If we have never read, experienced, or obtained the spiritual reality in Romans, then the doors into all the rest of Paul’s epistles will be closed to us. Understanding Romans leads us into the other epistles. Experiencing the judicial redemption and organic salvation in Romans opens up the divine and heavenly riches in Ephesians and Colossians. Without the experiences in Romans, reading Ephesians repeatedly will not transform us into a healthy and glorious church. Without the experiences in Romans, it is hard for us to understand and experience what Paul said to the Philippians:

_“I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.” – Philippians 3:12_

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, pages 12-13.
