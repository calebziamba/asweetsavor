_Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Immediately they left their nets and followed Him._ _– Matthew 4:19–20_

When God appears, He calls. These two actions are related. When the Lord appeared to Peter, Peter didn’t leave his nets until the Lord called him, saying, “Follow Me” (Matt. 4:19–20). When a great light shone and Saul fell to the ground, he didn’t just stand up and praise the Lord. Trembling and astonished, he asked, “What shall I do, Lord?” Jesus answered, “Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do” (Acts 22:10). The appearing brings in God’s calling, which is His living word.
