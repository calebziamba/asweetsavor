_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going._ _– Hebrews 11:8_

For us to walk with God as our way, He needs to appear to us that we might have faith. The more He appears, the more we have faith. Yet in the midst of tests and trials, we may find it hard to say, “I believe You, God.” When trials come, we find we don’t have the faith we thought we had. And yet, how is it that we continue to walk with Him as our way and consecrate our time to Him? We have to say it is beyond our reasoning, and we cannot but walk this way.
