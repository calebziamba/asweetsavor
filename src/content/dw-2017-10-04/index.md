_Abraham came near and said, “Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?...Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?”_ _– Genesis 18:23, 25_

Those who know God, as Abraham did, are one with God to such an extent that they are able to cooperate with Him to accomplish His will. It seems that Abraham had been gained by God and that God had been gained by Abraham. Abraham lived according to God’s leading, and God listened to his intercession. God and Abraham were one, and God’s desire was fulfilled.
