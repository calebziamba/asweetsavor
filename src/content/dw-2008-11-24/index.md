_In my distress I called out to the Lord. — Psalm 120:1_

_Bless the Lord now, all you servants of the Lord who stand by night in the house of the Lord. — Psalm 134:1_ Psalms 120 through 134 are referred to in the Bible as the “Psalms of Ascent.” Psalm 120 begins, “In my distress I called out to Jehovah.” This is a picture of regeneration. When we first cried out to the Lord, we were saved. The last Psalm of Ascent, Psalm 134, begins, “Bless the Lord now, all you servants of the Lord who stand by night in the house of the Lord.” Here we see servants of the Lord who are no longer in the world, but in the Lord's house. They stand “by night,” which refers to the time immediately before the Lord comes back. These servants are those who are standing for God's testimony and are exercising in the church life to bring the Lord back. Therefore, these fifteen short psalms give us an overall picture of our Christian growth from regeneration to the Lord's return.
