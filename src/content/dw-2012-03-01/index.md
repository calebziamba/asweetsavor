_The Lord is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are contrite in spirit. â€” Psalm 34:18_ To be contrite means to be deeply sorrowful and repentant. I believe David had a realization of how proud and self-sufficient he had been during the period of his manifestation. He once was a powerful man enjoying success, but now he realized that God was his only means of survival.

Therefore, he could say that the Lord was near to everyone who has a broken heart and saves such as have a spirit of deep repentance. David had so much to repent of, but he did not have time for regret. He was of a contrite spirit, and that was enough.
