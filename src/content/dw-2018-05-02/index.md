All of Paul’s epistles were written according to God’s will and exhibit how constituted and clear Paul was concerning this will. Each epistle reveals and testifies of God’s will, purpose, plan, and economy. In God’s wisdom, the first epistle we come to in the New Testament is the epistle to the Romans.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 4.
