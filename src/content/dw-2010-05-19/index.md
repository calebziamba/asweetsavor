_“Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock, Where do you make it lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?”_

_“If you yourself do not know, Most beautiful among women, Go forth in the footsteps of the flock And pasture your young goats By the shepherds’ tents.” — Song of Songs 1:7-8_

“Shepherds” is plural in number. If it were singular, it could refer to the Lord, but this is not the case in this verse. The shepherds in verse 8 actually refer to the frustrating “my mother’s sons” in verse 6. You may be unable to obey “my mother’s sons” and may argue with them because they are just slightly ahead of you in the church life and are not qualified to give you directions. You may also question why they don’t let you function according to your burden.
