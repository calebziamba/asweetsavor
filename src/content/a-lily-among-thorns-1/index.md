Many people around us are just like thorns, and in our fallen condition, we ourselves are at times like thorns to others. As long as we are living among fallen men, and have our own fallen human nature as well, many situations will arise to try us and even hurt us, like the piercing of the “thorns.” But, in the midst of such situations, we are the lilies trusting in the Lord’s care for us.
