_So Moses arose with Joshua his servant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God. — Exodus 24:13_

_“Let them construct a sanctuary for Me, that I may dwell among them.” — Exodus 25:8_ This sanctuary, the tabernacle Israel was to build as God’s dwelling place, would be His testimony among the nations.

We like feasting; the Lord likes being testified. The Lord satisfies us by becoming our feast; we satisfy Him by becoming His testimony.

You may have a very enjoyable church life, yet Christ may still not have His testimony. For this, we need to have the heart of a fighter. Joshua was the right person to accompany Moses for this assignment. The Lord’s charge was that Moses would build Him a tabernacle for His testimony. The people of Israel wanted something for their enjoyment, and the Lord promised to be that. However, the Lord’s desire was that His name would be exalted in their enjoyment of Him.
