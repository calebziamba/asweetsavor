> Now on the last day, the great _day_ of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’” But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet _given_, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

The Lord is always with you. The Lord says, “I am the Bread of Life. I am the Water of Life. I am the Light of Life. I am everything, I am ready to meet all of your needs as your supply.” ... In the New Testament, yes, the Lord Jesus is in you. He is so rich, He is the life store, and He is the storage house. He can give you all the riches you need as supply. There is nothing you need to worry and think about.
