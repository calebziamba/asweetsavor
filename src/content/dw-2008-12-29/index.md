_So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. — Ruth 2:3_

_And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. — Romans 8:28_

Ruth “happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz” (Ruth 2:3). I like the words “happened to.” It can refer both to things that go in our favor and those that seem to go against us. We Christians should never complain, for everything in our lives “happens to” work together for good (Rom. 8:28). In Ruth's case, she happened to find the field in which she needed to be.
