_But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them. And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus. â€”2 Timothy 3:14-15_

Before you can be equipped with the truth, you must know the facts in the Bible. You must be richly equipped with the facts of the Bible and familiar with what is contained in Scripture.

In his book _How to Study the Bible_, Brother Nee taught us that we all should have two Bibles. One should be without notes or markings that might affect our reading. Whenever we open this Bible, the Scripture should be fresh to us. This Bible is for us to gain our daily spiritual food. Then, in addition, we need another Bible in which we can underline and write down what we have learned through our study.
