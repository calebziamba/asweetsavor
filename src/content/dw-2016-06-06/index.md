According to Acts 26:18,  the Lord sent the apostle Paul to the Gentiles

_to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God._

This shows us that before we were saved, we were in Satan’s kingdom and under the authority of darkness, but now we have been brought into the kingdom of God’s beloved Son. Praise Him!
