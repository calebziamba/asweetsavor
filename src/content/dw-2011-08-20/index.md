_“I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not stir up nor awaken my love Until she pleases.” — Song of Songs 2:7_

The gazelles and the hinds of the fields are easily startled. When there is a little sound, they will run away. This indicates that such a saint is still young and easily startled. You have to be careful not to rouse up or awaken her. She is restful now in the presence of the Lord, and she is enjoying the sweetness of the Lord’s presence. You should not complain about this or “awaken” her until she pleases.

Is she spiritual? No. Has she matured yet? No. Has she grown up yet? No. She needs to press on. However, her pressing on takes time. It won’t happen through someone’s rebuking, reasoning, or preaching. She will eventually rouse herself and go forward.
