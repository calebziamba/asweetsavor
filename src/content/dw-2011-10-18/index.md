_For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. — Philippians 1:19

Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel. — Philippians 1:27_ Because they had the apostle in their heart and stood with him for the furtherance of the gospel, the saints prayed for the apostle in his imprisonment. The saints prayed when Peter was imprisoned (Acts 12:12), and here in Philippians we are told that the saints prayed when Paul was imprisoned. Because of that prayer, Paul received and enjoyed a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19).

In other words, the Lord began a good work in these saints and put them together with this apostle. Then they prayed for him, and through that prayer the apostle was supplied. Now Paul’s desire was to hear that they were standing firm and struggling together along with the faith of the gospel (Phil. 1:27). The faith of the gospel is personified here as something that is alive and struggling to advance.
