_“I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst....As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also will live because of Me.”_ _– John 6:35, 57_

It is by eating Christ as the bread of life that we are constantly made alive. Whenever we eat the bread of life, we live because of Him.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 88.
