Abigail returned home to Nabal, who was feasting like a king and becoming very drunk. The next morning, however, when Abigail told Nabal what had almost happened, “his heart died within him, and he became like a stone” (1 Sam 25:37).

Nabal was probably already overweight, and when he heard about how close he had come to being killed by David, it seems he had a stroke. Ten days later, the Lord struck him, and he died.
