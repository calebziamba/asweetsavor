_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

Being a fellow soldier is not related to the scale of what we do. We do not have to be one of David’s mighty men (2 Sam. 23:8–39). We do not have to get thirty people saved with one gospel message or heal a dying man. We simply have to be faithful to carry out the practical commitment the Lord has given to us in a spiritual way. In this way, we will become fellow soldiers struggling and fighting for the same goal—the Lord’s testimony.

There are many who, like Epaphroditus, are not that talented, manifested, or gifted, yet Paul called Epaphroditus his brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier. Today we also can together share this same life, commitment, and struggle for the Lord’s testimony.
