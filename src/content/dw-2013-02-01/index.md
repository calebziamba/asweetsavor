_“You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse;_ _You have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes,_ _With one strand of your necklace.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:9_

In 4:6 she had said, “I, for my part, will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.” Then the Lord calls her to come with Him, as seen here in 4:9.

She doesn’t say anything, but answers with one glance of her eyes, which tell Him that she is deeply joined to Him. Her reply is also manifested with the one strand of chain upon her neck. This necklace indicates that she cares for what the Lord cares for. The Lord is truly touched by her response.
