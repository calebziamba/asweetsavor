_Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches. Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?_ _– 2 Corinthians 11:28-29_

Paul cared for those who really needed care. Everyone loves to care for those who are doing well and who have obvious potential. When Paul spoke of his deep concern for the churches, however, he first referred to those who were weak.
