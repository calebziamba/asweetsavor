Christians can say, "We're in the New Covenant. Where is God? In my spirit. Where is He living? In my spirit. What is He doing? Operating in my spirit. What is His desire? To grow in my spirit and in the spirits of many other Christians. Together, we have an inward Christ, an inward, life-giving Lord." In the Old Testament, He's outside; in the New Testament, He's inside.

From _[Visions & Revelations, Volume One](https://www.asweetsavor.org/visions-and-revelations/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 27
