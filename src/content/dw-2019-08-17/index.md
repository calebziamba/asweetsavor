_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

It is not wrong to be gifted, nor should we despise our gifts; the Lord doesn’t ask the Shulammite to cut off all of her hair. However, we need to see that what God wants to do is to constitute our ministry, together with its gifts, with Himself, by weaving Himself into our natural abilities. What God cares for is not our gifts in themselves, but whether or not our gifts have been constituted with Himself as the crown of gold.
