_The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran._ _– Genesis 11:32_

God disciplines the believers both outwardly through their environment and inwardly through the discipline of the Spirit. The Spirit within restricts us, sometimes by withdrawing the sensation of His presence. God’s work in us takes away our reliance on natural things.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 94.
