_"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same  
things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you."  
\- Philippians 3:1  
_

If we are rejoicing in the living person of Christ, we are healthy and ready to advance along the route Paul portrayed in this chapter. If we are pursuing something other than Christ, even though it may be related to Him, we need to be brought back to Christ Himself.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 178.
