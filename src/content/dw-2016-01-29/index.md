_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... â€”Philippians 2:1_

Encouragement, consolation, and fellowship are accompanied by affection and compassion. Affection is within and is expressed through compassion. An affectionate person will do compassionate deeds.
