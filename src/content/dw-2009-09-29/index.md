_For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body. â€” Ephesians 5:23_ If you are a wife, your husband may not be a good head, but as long as he does not reject Christ, you must help your husband be under the headship of Christ. You cannot replace his headship.

In worldly society, when a man and woman get married, they immediately begin to struggle to see who will have control of their relationship. Most often, the wife wins and takes control of the family. She has many weapons: her tears, her anger, her threats to run home to her mother. This is not healthy. The wife should not win control of the family. She should learn to perfect her husband's headship.
