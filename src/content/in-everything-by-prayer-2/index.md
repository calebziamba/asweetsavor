> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
> 
> – Philippians 4:6 (NASB)

It is one thing to let others see our forbearance; it is another to be a praying person. As we exercise forbearance, we need to pray. Actually, in order to forbear and be free of anxiety, we need to pray. As Paul said, “In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God” (Phil. 4:6).
