_Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Behold, we have left all and followed You. What then will there be for us?" — Matthew 19:27_

_Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel's sake, But that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life." — Mark 10:2-30_

Some may ask, “If I give myself to the Lord, then what will my future be?” The Lord told Peter that whoever left all to follow Him would receive a hundredfold return in this age, and something eternal in the next age.

When someone begins to follow the Lord completely, the fruit will be manifold. Perhaps a brother may spend time and raise up only a few, yet those few may go on to raise up others, who then also become this brother's spiritual descendants. In such a way, many will greet this brother and own that they are his children in the coming age.

To our feeling, we may not see much result as we serve and follow the Lord. We may even feel discouraged about our seeming lack of impact. The Lord, however, may see something far different and may be quite happy with our labor. Just follow Him and let Him measure you until the flow of the divine stream carries you, and one day you will see how your following Him has become a blessing to many others.
