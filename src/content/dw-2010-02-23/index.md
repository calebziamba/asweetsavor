_Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works. — John 14:10_

When we are willing to do anything to please our wives and children, we do not see this as a duty, because there is so much satisfaction in pleasing those you love. Your behavior reflects your love. You will not put the same thought and energy into buying something for one of your in-laws, because they do not occupy that special place in your heart. You are not doing something merely because it needs to be done.

The concern and attention involved in this kind of love may help us understand the concept of mutual abiding between the Father and the Son. There is such a union, such a oneness, between the Father and the Son. There is no way to separate them. The Father’s desire occupies the Son, and the Son speaks out what the Father desires. So the Father who is in the Son does His work. This is the model. Such a model displays this very God, the God of oneness.
