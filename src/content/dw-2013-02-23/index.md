_“Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates_ _With choice fruits, henna with nard plants,_ _ Nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,_ _With all the trees of frankincense,_ _Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:13-14_

_So then death operates in us, but life in you._ _— Second Corinthians 4:12_

Here the Lord seems to tell His seeker, “Death has had its operation in you, and now, through your union with Me, you are full of supply.” As Paul testified, “So then death operates in us, but life in you” (2 Cor. 4:12).

Brothers and sisters, when you read this book, you will find that the Lord doesn’t care for much other than love and the cross. If you love the Lord, you must take up the cross, and the more you take up the cross, the more you will love the Lord. The Lord always confronts you with these two matters. He is not interested in your work nor in your spirituality. This is totally a matter of life. You will grow in life spontaneously through love and the cross.
