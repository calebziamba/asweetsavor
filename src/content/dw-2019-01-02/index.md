Isaac wasn’t clear about God’s care for him. When he was reproached by Abimelech for lying about his wife, he should have recognized God’s protecting hand, built an altar to renew his consecration, and thanked God for His protection. But he didn’t. When he reaped a hundredfold, he again should have recognized God’s hand and offered to God. However, he still didn’t do it. He couldn’t see God’s hand until God appeared to him at Beersheba, saying,

_“I am the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you, and multiply your descendants, for the sake of My servant Abraham.” So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well._ _– Genesis 26:23–25_

At this time, he began to understand that he was in God’s hand.
