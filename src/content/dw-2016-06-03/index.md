After being born again, we are justified. To be justified means that God approves us according to the standard of His righteousness. Formerly, we were in sin and therefore under Godâ€™s righteous judgment, but now we are acceptable to God because we have believed in Christ and thus received His redemption. Romans 3:24 says we are

_justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus._

Romans 5:1 says,

_Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ._
