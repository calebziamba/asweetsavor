We should enjoy Christ as our good Shepherd. The Lord says in John 10:11,

_I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep._

And in John 10:14 He says,

_I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; pages 78-79.
