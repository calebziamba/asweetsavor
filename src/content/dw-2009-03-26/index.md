_But God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved). — Eph. 2:3-4_

The next eight points all concern what we are in, now that we have been born again. First, we are in the Triune God. Before we were born again we were in Satan's kingdom, but now we are in the Triune God Himself. When the Lord Jesus was still on the earth, He prayed to the Father for all of His believers: “That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me” (John 17:21). The Lord prayed for us to be in the Triune God, and this has been accomplished. We know this from Colossians 3:3: “For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.” After being born again we are in the Triune God.

Before we were born again, we were in death: “And you, though dead in your offenses and sins” (Eph. 2:1). But when we were born again we were made alive (Eph. 2:3-4). Our new position after being born again is in life. “Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has passed out of death into life” (John 5:24). Formerly we were in death, but now we are in life.

Before we were born again we were in darkness, but now we are in light: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1Ã‚Â Pet. 2:9). “For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light” (Eph. 5:8). “Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light” (Col. 1:12). As those who are born again, we are the “saints in the light.”
