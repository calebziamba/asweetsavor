_“And I will make you a great nation,_ _And I will bless you,_ _And make your name great;_ _And so you shall be a blessing.”_ _–  Genesis 12:2_

The more we gain Christ, the more we express this “great nation,” for God is reigning over us. Sometimes when we see older believers, we feel that the Lord’s authority and reigning is with them. We should all aspire to gain the Lord to this extent.
