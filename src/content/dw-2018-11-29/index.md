_But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know._ _– 1 John 2:20_

I do not like it when people tell me how good my message was, yet it has no effect on their living. A good message should give everyone the feeling that something has just begun.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 152.
