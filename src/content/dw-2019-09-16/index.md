_Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob - Genesis 25:26_

_And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright._ _\- Genesis 25:31_

If asked why he struggled with Esau in his mother’s womb, Jacob would have said, “It was for me! I was struggling to get the birthright.” Since Jacob was unsuccessful in being born first, he probably thought everyday about how to gain the birthright. He knew he had to have it in order to gain God’s blessing and his father’s riches. Eventually he found the secret. Each time Esau came back from hunting, he was faint from hunger. Therefore Jacob made red lentil stew and refused to give any to Esau until he gave him the birthright (Gen. 25:29–34). Once Esau agreed, Jacob obtained the right to his father’s earthly possessions and God’s heavenly promise.
