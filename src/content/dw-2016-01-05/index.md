_And Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech._ _–  Genesis 5:25_

We need to be more like John the Baptist, who was not afraid of people or authority. He was strong and bold in order to be faithful to God’s commitment. Not caring who opposed him, he willingly sacrificed his life (Mark 6:17–18). He was beside himself for the Lord to the uttermost.

We don’t have much time. Today is the day to be wild for the Lord! We shouldn’t wait until we are older, know more, and have become leaders in the church. We need to be beside ourselves today.
