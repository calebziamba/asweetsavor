> For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ
> 
> \- Philippians 3:20

No matter how much we have grown, no matter how rich our enjoyment of Christ has been, no matter how much we  
are able to live a life in oneness with Christ, we still need Jesus as our Savior.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 250
