_Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires._ _– Galatians 5:24_

_But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world._ _– Galatians 6:14_

Before the Lord returns and our bodies are transfigured, the flesh, the world, and the lusts are always here. How we need the Lord’s mercy! We have to pray, “Lord, please preserve me with a good personality and help it grow in Your mercy. I would like to be kept away from the world and the flesh.”
