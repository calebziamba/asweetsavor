_“You are altogether beautiful, my darling,_ _And there is no blemish in you._ _Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:7-8_

The land of Lebanon refers to the Lord’s resurrection and ascension. The Lord calls her to move with Him in the realm of ascension.

He is telling her, “You have to be in the transcendence of My ascension. You need to look at things from ascension. Do not remain in your own pursuing, your own little work, and your plans for the future. You have to be with Me in the realm where I am, in the heavens, to consider the things of the Spirit, to co-labor with Me, and to accomplish My desire.”
