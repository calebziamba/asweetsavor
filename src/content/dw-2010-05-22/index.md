_“Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock, Where do you make it lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?”_

_“If you yourself do not know, Most beautiful among women, Go forth in the footsteps of the flock And pasture your young goats By the shepherds’ tents.” — Song of Songs 1:7-8_

If we truly love the Lord, we will treasure the experiences of those who have loved Christ before us. We may love the Lord and yet say, “What relevance do Madame Guyon and John Wesley have for us today? They are out of date as far as the Lord’s move is concerned.” If this is our feeling, we may end up missing the footsteps of the flock.

If we love the Lord and wish to follow Him in life, we must receive the learning experiences left for us by those who have gone before. Moreover, if we truly love the Lord, we cannot separate ourselves from the shepherds among us; rather, we should recognize those whom the Lord has placed among us as shepherds. Then, we just pasture our young goats by the shepherds’ tents.
