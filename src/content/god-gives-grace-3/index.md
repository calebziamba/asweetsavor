If you really study the Greek, John means “God gives grace”

The Lord Jesus Christ is gracious. In His grace we have Him. In His grace we have Him abiding in us. In His grace we can be one with Him. In His grace we can grow in Him. In His grace we can live by Him and with Him. In His grace we can enjoy Him and partake of Him. In His grace we are short of nothing, because we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit, who is just Christ Himself.
