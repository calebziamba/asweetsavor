_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

The Shulammite’s experience of the Lord in chapter 1 is her song of songs. In chapter 8, she is still experiencing the Lord as her song of songs. No matter where we are, how many years we have followed the Lord, or how young or mature we are spiritually, as long as we are a normal Christian, we should have the Lord as our song of songs. To live a life as a lover of the Lord is to pursue the song that is above all songs.
