_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

In these messages we shall consider our Christian experience as portrayed in the Song of Songs. Every sentence in the Song of Songs portrays a spiritual experience. If we identify with what is shared, it indicates that we have had the experience. If, however, we are puzzled by what is shared, it indicates that we have not yet entered into that experience. Even so, all of us can learn from this book, and any who desire a deeper experience of the Lord need to spend time in the Song of Songs.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 11.
