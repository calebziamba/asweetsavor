_When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness....But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life._ _– Romans 6:20, 22_

Formerly we were slaves of sin, but after being born again we are set free from sin. This means that sin cannot bother us anymore. We should remember this whenever Satan comes to accuse us. Whenever we hear the enemy say, “You claim to be a Christian, but look at what you just did!” we can simply reply, “The Lord has set me free from sin!”
