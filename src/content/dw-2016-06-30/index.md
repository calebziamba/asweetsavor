_When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness....But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life._ _– Romans 6:20, 22_

Whenever we hear the enemy say, “You claim to be a Christian, but look at what you just did!” we can simply reply, “The Lord has set me free from sin!”

This should be our answer to any of the enemy’s accusations. Satan wants us to be occupied with our sin, but we should not accept his accusations, because the Bible tells us that we are now free from sin.
