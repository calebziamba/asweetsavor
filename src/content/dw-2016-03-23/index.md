God told Noah to build an ark three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high with lower, second, and third decks (vv. 15–16). God’s word really got into his heart: “According to all that God had commanded him, so he did” (v. 22). What God spoke was living to him and became part of him. He didn’t forget about it.

We also have the word, but it may not be living in us and controlling us. We have the word but it may not be our life supply. God gained Noah through His living word which energized him to carry out God’s command.
