_Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth. —2 Timothy 2:15_

A certain brother taught Greek at a theological school. He left Christianity and met with us after receiving the vision of the Lord’s recovery. I often invited him to visit the nearby churches so we could have some fellowship. I usually used the opportunity to ask him questions about the meaning of some words in the original text of the New Testament. Once I asked him, “Who is best in Greek among the contemporary Bible teachers?” He said, “Brother Lee.” I was surprised. He explained, “Because he explains the Greek based on revelation.” This brother really had insight. The Scripture is based on revelation. Brother Lee is equipped with the truth, so he has the ability to explain the Greek.

A dull and senseless person has no ability to appreciate the beauty of art. You must be a person sensitive to art to appreciate it. The same principle applies to spiritual things. If you are a person with revelation in truth and in spiritual things, you are able to appreciate, enter into, and apply the divine realities.

A musician must learn to appreciate all kinds of music. Likewise, a person who desires to pursue the truth should cultivate the ability to study and apply the truth. Brother Lee is clear about the truth of the Bible. Therefore, he is able to study Greek and use it freely.
