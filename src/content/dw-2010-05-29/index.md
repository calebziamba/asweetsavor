_“You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself.” — Exodus 19:4_

We shouldn’t be concerned about how hard we try to serve the Lord. When Watchman Nee passed away, there were perhaps sixty thousand meeting in the churches in China raised up through his ministry. Today, however, after thirty-six years, there are at least six million meeting in China who do not focus upon any particular practice or method but simply stand according to the truth revealed in the word.

What was it that Watchman Nee did to nurture this? We cannot point to any particular matter. God just desires to bear us on His wings into the divine, mystical, heavenly realm so that we may focus on Christ Himself. As for His work, that is up to Him.
