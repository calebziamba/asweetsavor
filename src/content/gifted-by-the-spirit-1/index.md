> _“Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are differences of operation, but it is the same God who operates all things in all.”_

> _(1 Corinthians 12:4-6)_

You see here, in these three simple verses, it tells us how to have a healthy church life. It doesn't go in this way:: I get promoted, I get promoted, I get promoted. No! It goes in this way: You first have to realize, are you born again? Are you born again? Okay, so you have the Spirit, don’t you? When the Spirit came into you, do you know what you received? You received a gift. Every one of us is gifted.
