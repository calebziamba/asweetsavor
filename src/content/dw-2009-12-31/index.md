_And it happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet. He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your maid. Spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative.” — Ruth 3:8-9

_When Boaz discovered Ruth at his feet, risking everything, including her reputation, he asked her, “Who are you?” I somewhat believe that he knew, but he was in a state of marveling. Ruth replied, “I am Ruth, your maidservant. Take your maidservant under your wing, for you are a close relative” (Ruth 3:9). Ruth seemed to be saying, “I already belong to you. Now marry me. You have taken me in; now complete what you have begun.”

Boaz was a close relative to the husband Ruth had lost, and it was Boaz’s duty to raise up children in the name of her dead husband (Deut. 25:5). Boaz had already spoken of how she had come to Israel to seek protection under the wing of Jehovah (Ruth 2:12). He was confident that Jehovah would recompense her. Now she had taken refuge under Boaz’s wing, and was reminding him of his words. Her meaning was very plain; she was telling Boaz, “Marry me.”

We need such a desirous heart toward the Lord. On the one hand, we should lay aside all that we have: our hopes, aspirations, dreams, expectations, and desires. On the other hand, we should place ourselves and our future firmly at the Lord’s mercy. We should give ourselves to Him alone, not based upon anything we have, but fully upon the work He has already begun in us. Then we should take the opportunities that the Lord gives us to grow to fullness under the direction of those who have the ability to discern both our condition and how the Lord is moving. In this kind of situation, we should lay hold of the Lord. We should be direct with Him for His testimony’s sake. It is no longer for our sakes that we seek Him; it is for what is on His heart. We are asking Him for what He wants, and this startles Him.
