_I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad. Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together. — Psalm 34:1-3_

David never dwelt in defeat. Though he confronted all kinds of difficulty and hardship, he never gave up. Even Elijah, one of the greatest prophets in the Old Testament, had times when he wanted to give up (1 Kings 19:2–4). David never acted this way, for he knew how to turn to the Lord and trust in Him, even in the midst of failure. Those who came to David must have been impressed by how he could write Psalm 34 while hiding in the cave of Adullam.
