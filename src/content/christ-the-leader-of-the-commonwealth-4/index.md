> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> â€” Philippians 3:20 Darby

We can all be saved from walking as enemies of the cross, saved from the shame of our humble state, and saved from the earthly things, for we are heavenly people in this heavenly commonwealth that has Christ as its everything.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 247
