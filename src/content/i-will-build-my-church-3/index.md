> And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.

> I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.

Paul defined the church (_ekklesia_) as the body of Christ... This body is His testimony, and this body needs to be builded up. Think about what “builded up” means. For a building it means I bring things which are not related to become related; I bring things which are isolated to become a part of the overall structure; I bring things which have very little value to become something of a grand, precious building. You know, brothers, if we see a physical building, we have this view: “What a marvelous building!” Now, how about a spiritual building? The Lord says we are a spiritual body that needs to be builded up as a testimony. So what are we? We are members to be builded up.
