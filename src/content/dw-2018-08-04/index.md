_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Experiencing salvation by God’s life brings in sanctification, transformation, and glorification. It is through being saved by His life that we experience organic salvation, and the more we are saved by His life, the richer our experience of organic salvation will be.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 15.
