_I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. â€”Romans 12:1_ Paul says this living sacrifice is our reasonable service. Service is to do something based on the fact that you are a living sacrifice. Your whole life is a life of sacrifice. Nothing will be for you; nothing will be for your profit. In the Old Testament, the offerings were sacrificed within one day, and God was satisfied. I have been on the altar, being burned by the Lord, for 50 years. For some reason, I still have not become ashes. To follow the Lord is to be a living sacrifice. It is not what you want, but what the Lord wants; not what makes you happy, but what makes the Lord happy.
