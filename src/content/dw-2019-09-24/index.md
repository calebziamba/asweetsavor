_Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob - Genesis 25:26_

A prevailing man doesn’t exalt God but sees himself equal to God. God appeared to Jacob at Bethel and spoke to him. Jacob answered, “If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take...of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You” (28:20, 22). Jacob was not afraid of God. He didn’t think God was the Most High. He thought he was equal to God. Therefore, he dared to bargain with God—if You do this for me, I will do that for You.
