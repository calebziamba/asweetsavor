> And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

> \- 1 John 5:11

It doesn’t matter to this life where you are at. If you say, “since this is the case I won’t pray anymore, just so I can prove that He is such a One in me.” Just try it; see if you can. I’m never afraid that people might argue with this life or try to test it; I am more concerned when people learn to ignore the operation of this life within them.
