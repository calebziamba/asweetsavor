_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Paul realized that the Philippians  were confronting a problem. Since Philippi was a garrison city for the Roman army, many of the believers there were probably soldiers who tended to be competitive. Paul warned them, “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves” (2:3).
