_O taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him! — Psalm 34:8_

So David arose and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. — First Samuel 27:2

The first time David had gone to Gath, he felt he had to pretend to be mad so he could escape, for someone had told Achish who he was (1 Sam. 21:10-15). After he escaped from Gath, he dwelt in the cave of Adullam, where he found that the Lord was his strength. It was there he wrote Psalm 34, which contains the words, “Taste and see that the Lord is good” (v. 8).

After this he passed through the experiences of Keilah, Ziph, En Gedi, Paran, and to Ziph once more. Now he came to King Achish as a different David—instead of feigning madness, he comes as commander of an army of six hundred.
