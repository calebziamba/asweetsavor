_“How beautiful you are, my darling,  
How beautiful you are!”  
– Song of Songs 1:15  
_

We are often very shallow. When there is a cross for us, our feeling is that the Lord is beating us for something we have done wrong. We think, “He is disciplining me because I am bad. The Lord is breaking me because I am terrible. It is all due to my being such a difficult person.” However, the Lord says, instead, “You are beautiful! Oh, you are so beautiful!” We think we are too terrible to match the Lord. But the Lord says, “Do not focus on your weakness, for I do not pay attention to your weakness, failure, and uncleanness. When you enjoy Me as your fountain of life and hide in Me, you are indeed beautiful.” 

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, pages 64-65.
