_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’”_ _–  Acts 7:2-3_

Abraham failed many times. God had promised to give him a son, saying, “I will bless \[Sarah\], and indeed I will give you a son by her (17:16). However, Abraham told King Abimelech that Sarah was his sister and gave her to him (Gen. 20:2). How could Abraham have a son by Sarah if he sent her away? Without Sarah, his life of following God would have been almost in vain. Although Abraham sent Sarah away, God protected her so that Abimelech never came near her (v. 4).
