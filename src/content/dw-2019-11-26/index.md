_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son_  
_–_ _Romans_ _1:1-3_

The word “gospel” is singular in the Greek text, which shows that it is God’s unique good news. The Bible contains many promises that God has given us, which include aspects of peace, joy, and blessing. However, the unique good news that God promises us is nothing but the Son of God Himself, Jesus Christ. Therefore, when we share this good news with others it must lead them unto Christ Himself. He is then the source and center of all the riches we find in the gospel.

In the New Testament age, all the Old Testament types of the gospel are fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Christ is the ruling king and reality of the whole New Testament age. In this reality, He also becomes our riches—our healing, protection, and glorious hope. In this proclaimed age full of hope, He is our sacrifice so that we might come close to God. He is also the reality of the wonderful feasts of God’s people, and through Him, we can enjoy God with great joy.
