_For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church. — Ephesians 5:31-32_

The religious world uses us; it does not care about us. The Lord, on the other hand, cares for us and fights for what would be a blessing to us. He is struggling for us to mature. He is not taking advantage of us. We are to be His wife (Eph. 5:31–32), and obtaining Him becomes our highest blessing. Religion only seeks to thwart this so that it may maintain and expand its existence with its laws, ideologies, and exaltation of the self.
