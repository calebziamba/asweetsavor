_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

It is often said that _agape_ love is God’s love. This is true, but more accurately, _agape_ is the love of what is esteemed to be of high value. In the Septuagint, the word _agape_ is used when speaking of parents’ love for their children, because parents prize and value their children above all else and seek what is best for them.

When we are caring for our fellow believers, do we value them in this way? If not, then what we offer them is not true consolation.
