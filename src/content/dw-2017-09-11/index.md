_Then behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.”_ _– Genesis 15:4_

Isaac, the promised seed, was born of Sarah. He became Abraham’s sole heir (Gen. 25:5). He represents what is born of the spirit (Gal. 4:29). Only that which is born of the Spirit is acceptable and fulfills God’s promise. If we try to use our natural concept (Eliezer), God will reject it. If we try to use our law-keeping flesh (Ishmael), God will tell us to cast it out. Only what is born of the Spirit (Isaac) fulfills God’s promise and can remain. If we live and labor according to the principle of Isaac, God will have a way in us.
