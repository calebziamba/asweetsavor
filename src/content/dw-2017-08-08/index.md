_For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ._ _– 1 Corinthians 3:11_

Since our first vision is of Christ, He is our foundation (1 Cor. 3:11). We don’t need to consider whether we will bless others by becoming apostles, elders, or vessels greatly used by God. It is not our business but the Lord’s. We only need to ask whether we have the Lord’s appearing.
