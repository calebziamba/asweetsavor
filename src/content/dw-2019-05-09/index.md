_“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2, KJV_

One who does not love the Lord may say many things, but what he speaks is just so many empty words. In contrast, one who does love the Lord is simple and is very clear. When he talks about the Lord he is full of feelings: “He is so precious. He has ravished my heart. I miss Him.”

by Titus Chu, page 19.
