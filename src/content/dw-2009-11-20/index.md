You must have the Spirit, you must have spiritual understanding, you must be one who reacts to things spiritually, and you must become increasingly more spiritually sensitive. You must be able to see all things spiritually, and be able to know and help people spiritually. It is crucial that you develop spiritual awareness. If you become spiritually keen, and if your spirit is strong, rich, and full of the operation of life, then you will be a person full of anointing.
