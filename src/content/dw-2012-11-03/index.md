"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

Everything the Lord did when He was on the earth was precious, but without His death none of it had any value. His death was what counted. His death had the highest value. We must remember that the Lord was prepared to fall into the ground and die. All of His trust was in the resurrection life.
