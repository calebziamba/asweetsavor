“Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house,

Or go up to the comfort of my bed;

I will not give sleep to my eyes

Or slumber to my eyelids,

Until I find a place for the Lord,

A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”

— Psalm 132:3-5 This is very hard to understand, and we must apply this in the way of experience. The psalmist, quoting David, says, “I shall not go into the tent of my house.” The word “tent” here can also be translated “tabernacle.” In the Old Testament the tabernacle of God was His dwelling place. Therefore the phrase “the tent of my house” actually means “the tabernacle, God’s dwelling place, of my house.” But how can our house be the tabernacle? We would think that each of us has our own house, and God’s tabernacle is a separate matter. But David said, “the tent of my house.” David was a mature person who could testify that his house was God’s tabernacle, and God’s tabernacle was his house. In other words, David did not have a habitation separate and apart from God’s dwelling place. Adapted from _[The Journey of Life,](/book-journey "Go to the listing for this book.")_ page 99.
