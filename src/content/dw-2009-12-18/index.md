We have to be careful about our prophesying. There are many  who are speaking for the Lord, but what really matters is who the speaker is.

It is not a small matter to minister for the Lord. We must pray, “Lord, I need Your mercy in my speaking. I desire to supply life to the saints, so I ask You that I might be constituted with the divine life and its riches, and richly possess the feeling of life, the manifestation of life, and the testimony of life. I desire not only to be a person living in life, but also a person through whom the divine life can be ministered to others.”

If you serve the Lord in this way, you will respect yourself, your speaking, and your portion. You will not look down on yourself. When you speak in oneness with the Lord, your word will be able to build up the church, perfect the saints, and adequately supply life.
