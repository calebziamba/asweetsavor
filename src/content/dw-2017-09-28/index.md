_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

_Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb._ _– Romans 4:19_

Although we are as good as dead, we have God’s promise. Although we have His promise, we don’t have the assurance. Although we don’t have the assurance, we can trust. Although we can trust, we cannot believe. Although we cannot believe, we cannot give up on the Lord. We are completely exposed to God and begin to know ourselves and our real situation.
