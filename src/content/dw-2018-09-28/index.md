Regardless of Peter’s inability to apprehend what Paul had seen, Paul still sought fellowship in humility. Peter also had an understanding concerning many things. They were two servants of the Lord who had received revelation from God, so their fellowship together would have been a mutual help.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 141-142.
