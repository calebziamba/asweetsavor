> But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:13b-14 ESV

Christ is not a fixed goal. He keeps just ahead of us, based upon our pursuing. If He allowed Himself to be laid hold of, we would stop pursuing. Because we need to be continually growing and maturing, Christ as our goal always remains just ahead of us, calling us onward to a deeper, richer union with Himself.
