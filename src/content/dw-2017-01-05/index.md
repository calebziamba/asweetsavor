We need to realize we have been transferred into God’s kingdom, and so we also need to realize that we now have many fellow citizens with us in God’s kingdom, namely, our fellow believers in Christ. Ephesians 2:19 says,

_You are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household._
