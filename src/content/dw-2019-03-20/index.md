_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

The book of Philippians begins with this introduction:  
  
_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._ _– Philippians 1:1_  
  
Timothy served with Paul not only as a child with a father but also as a fellow bond-servant of Christ Jesus. This service was an important part of their relationship. They both took the stand of absolute surrender to the Lord.
