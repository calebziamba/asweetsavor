_O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; Nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me — Psalm 131:1

I would not have the restless will that hurries to and fro, Seeking for some great thing to do or secret thing to know; I would be treated as a child, and guided where I go. — Anna Laetitia Waring_

As we have said, Psalm 131 is very different from the previous Psalms of Ascent. Not long ago we were like a “mighty man with arrows” (Ps. 127:4); we were like a fruitful vine and an olive tree (Ps. 128:3). But now we are different. Because of the Lord’s environmental arrangement and the shining of His light, we can say, “Lord, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me.” We have reached a level of maturity.

Both this psalm and this hymn have a sweet fragrance. When we have entered into this experience we may not do so much or be so active, yet our very person becomes a great blessing to the Lord’s testimony.
