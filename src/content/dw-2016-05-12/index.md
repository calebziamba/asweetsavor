_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

The clause “regard one another as more important than yourselves” means to consider others “to be above, be superior in rank, authority, power” (Thayer, p. 641).

Adapted from __[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ,](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")__ page 100.
