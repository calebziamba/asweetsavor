_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

If we want to serve the Lord effectively and have a proper operation before Him, there are secrets we must learn. The first, most crucial, and most basic of these secrets is the secret of being a seed.

This may seem very simple, and we may think that we know it already. Still, we must ask, what does it really mean to be a seed? If someone considers us to be a coworker, a full-timer, a leader, or an elder, that makes us feel very good. To be a pillar in our locality, or to be an operative blessing to the churches, appears to be quite glorious. In contrast, a seed is not seen or appreciated; there is no glory, and there is no manifestation. Nonetheless, if we desire to serve the Lord effectively, we must be a seed.

As we shall see, there are three basic principles for being a seed. First, a seed is hidden. Second, a seed is full of life. Finally, a seed is ready to grow and bear fruit. If we want to be a seed, we must learn to live according to these three principles.
