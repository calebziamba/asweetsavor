_"I am the rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys."_

_"As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters."_

_— Song of Songs 2:1-2_ When we realize that we are nothing but a rose of Sharon and a lily of the valleys, living by God’s mercy and care (2:1), God will then bring us into deeper visions and experiences. He tells us, “As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters” (2:2).

When we walk by faith, we will become like a lily among thorns. This means we will encounter many situations along the way that are the result of mankind’s fallen condition.
