_Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.  
__– 2 Timothy 2:15_  
  
How much do we know the Bible? Knowing the Bible does not necessarily mean we can recall every verse perfectly, but at least we should know there is such a verse. Although we may not have thoroughly studied every part of the Bible, we should at least have a general familiarity with the thought of each book. If we want to be approved as servants of the Lord, we have to know the Bible.
