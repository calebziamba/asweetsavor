_So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all are yours. â€” First Corinthians 3:21-22._

Paul realized that no matter how rich and spiritual his ministry was, he was only one among many ministers of Christ. He further realized that whatever portion any minister had, it was for the church.
