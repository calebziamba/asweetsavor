In God’s view, there is only one church in each locality. This is the local church. We should have a comprehensive and accurate understanding of local churches. Every believer in a city is part of the local church in that city. In other words, a local church includes all the believers in that locality. A person who understands the church will not see denominational lines and will be able to accommodate all believers. Such people are extremely broad; they are broad in their hearts, fields of labor, attitudes regarding spiritual exercises, and fellowship. They realize that the local church exists for the body of Christ—which all regenerated believers are part of—and for the testimony of His body.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 19.
