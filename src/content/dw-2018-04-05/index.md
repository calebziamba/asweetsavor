_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. —Philippians 2:16_

Paul ran at an advanced level, opening the way for others to run as well. The Philippians’ holding fast the word of life as Paul did became proof that his running had not been in vain.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 133-134.
