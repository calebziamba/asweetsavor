_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _â€” Philippians 2:2-4_

To think of others as being more important than ourselves is not something we can do naturally. We are inclined to neglect others and to lift ourselves above them, boasting in what is good about ourselves. This kind of mind, however, is not good for the body life.
