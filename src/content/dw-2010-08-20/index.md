_“I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots. Your cheeks are lovely with plaits of ornaments,_ _Your neck with strings of jewels.” — Song of Songs 1:9-10_ During a prevailing conference, hundreds of saints may declare their consecration to the Lord. For the most part, these declarations are just strings of jewels. Until the day our consecration is tested by the Lord, we won’t realize how hard our neck really is.

The seeker here appears to love the Lord, and thinks she loves the Lord, but that is not truly the case. Her appearing tender and submissive before others is just an outward string of jewels and is not out of the constitution of life. Before men, she makes plaits in her hair, and before God, she wears a string of jewels. No matter how her hair is plaited, however, or what she does to string jewels around her neck, God can perceive that she is yet a wild mare.
