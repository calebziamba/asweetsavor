_I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long; but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth._ _– First Timothy 3:14-15_

After the epistles to the Thessalonians we come to 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, which cover church administration. As we grow in life, we eventually need to handle church affairs. Yet included in this section there is a very sweet book—Philemon.

After such a substantial portion in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus regarding elders, deacons, and administrative matters, we need something sweet. The first three books are like a steak, and Philemon is like a sweet dessert. Philemon has only one chapter but it is rich in life, in brotherly love, and in the operation of the apostle Paul.
