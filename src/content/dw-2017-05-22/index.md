As believers in Christ, we should not consider ourselves as mere churchgoers, nor should we be satisfied with “going to heaven.” If we cannot enjoy Christ today, then what is the point of hoping for the future? We should not allow ourselves to be cheated. We were born again so that we could enjoy Christ today!

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 70.
