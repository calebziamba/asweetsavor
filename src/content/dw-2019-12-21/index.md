_“Your eyes are like doves.”  
– Song of Songs 1:15  
_

As we gain spiritual insight we will be brought into another realm, one in which we touch the source of life, not merely the outward situation. If our eyes are focused solely on the Lord, we will not try to hold on to any spiritual thing, and we will not try to be spiritual. We will simply live in the spirit, and this will enable us to have the genuine spiritual discernment. Although our beauty and purity are not yet complete, and we remain weak and in need of the Lord’s breaking work, we can still have eyes like doves. The way for us to follow the Lord is to possess such insight, such “eyes...like doves.”
