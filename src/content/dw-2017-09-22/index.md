_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

Did Abraham stop following the Lord since His words seemed so incredible? No, he just fell upon his face and laughed with a lot of feeling. Perhaps he thought, “O Lord, if only You had come ten years earlier!” Or he may have thought, “God, do You know what You are talking about?” or “O God, do not speak like this. I cannot take it.” At this point, Abraham had lost all confidence in his own ability.
