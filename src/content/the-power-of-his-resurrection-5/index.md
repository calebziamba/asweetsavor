> â€”Philippians 3:10

Christ brought us all into His resurrection. Thus, we are in the heavenly places with Him already and have access to this power for whatever is needed in our Christian lives. We will face thousands of challenges and experience continuous needs as believers, but this unfailing power is always present with us to uphold and supply us.

From [Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/) by Titus Chu, p. 195
