_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

Each generation stresses something that will damage a person’s humanity. For instance, a trend of this age is to endorse homosexuality. Certain Christian denominations even promote the idea of homosexual marriage. This crookedness frustrates people from discovering what God intends for them as human beings.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 125.
