_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _â€”Philippians 2:3_

Throughout the years, I have noticed that selfish ambition is one of the most difficult matters that a Christian worker confronts. For some reason, it is difficult for us to be happy simply with pleasing the Lord.

We should be careful of our motive in expanding our Christian work. For over fifty years, I have served the Lord according to the principle that if He opens a door, I enter; if He paves three feet of road, I walk three feet. We should fully utilize whatever the Lord measures to us and develop it for His interest (2 Cor. 10:13). We should not desire anything for ourselves.
