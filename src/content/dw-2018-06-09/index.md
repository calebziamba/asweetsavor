_Now you are Christ’s body, and individually members of it._ _– 1 Corinthians 12:27_

In the body of Christ, we see God’s wisdom in an even greater way than in the human body. Now that we are born again, we can no longer remain as isolated individuals, for we have received the need for a new living, a corporate living in which we are the members of the body of Christ and in which we function in harmony with all the other members of this body. Where do we experience this in a practical way? In the local church life.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 98.
