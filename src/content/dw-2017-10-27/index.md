_He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering.”_ _– Genesis 22:2_

God’s desire is that we have nothing but Himself. When Abraham was about to offer up Isaac, he was heartbroken. God had appeared to him and led him to this point. But now, it seemed that all His promises were gone. All His blessings were lost. All He had said was in vain. Abraham had nothing now but God. He had no choice but to believe in God and obey Him. All his experiences—victory and failure, strength and weakness, honor and dishonor—were now gone. Now he was going to take the knife and slay Isaac, through whom all God’s promises were to be fulfilled. His life had come to an end. He would follow God regardless of the cost, since all things are from Him.
