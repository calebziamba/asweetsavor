_Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and became the father of a son. Now he called his name Noah, saying, “This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands.”_ _–  Genesis 5:28–29_

Noah means “repose” (Hitchcock). The more we are like Lamech, the more we trust the Lord and are peaceful in spirit. Although we labor with sweat and tears, we have the assurance that it is not us but the Lord who does the work. The will of God can be fulfilled through those who have such restful assurance. When people see us, they should see those who labor and toil outwardly yet are restful inwardly. This is Noah.
