_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._ _– Philippians 1:1_

_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_  
  
This life relationship is spiritual. It is not common, worldly, or merely human. We may love other believers for many years, invest ourselves in them, and watch them grow and develop with great expectation, but if one day they refuse to take a stand as bond-servants of Christ, that will be the end of the spiritual relationship. We may still be friends, but the father-child relationship will end. It is not because mistakes were made but because the stand as a bond-servant of Christ Jesus was lost.
