_Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions. — Colossians 1:24_ What is the operation for the living out of the oneness portrayed in Colossians? First, Colossians reveals that the living out of the oneness comes about through the suffering of the apostles. Second, the living out of the oneness comes about through the struggling of the apostles. Third, it comes about through the living of the saints. Finally, the living that produces the oneness issues out of the saints being together.
