_You are My friends if you do what I command you._ _– John 15:14_

You should tell the Lord, “Lord, I’m thankful that You are my Friend, and I can tell You everything. Lord, let me tell You about all my problems. Let me tell You about all my frustrations.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 77.
