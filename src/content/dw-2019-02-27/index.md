_I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly.  
__– Philippians 2:19_

Throughout our whole life, knowing the body will be a test to us. In our church life, we will receive directions and suggestions about how and where to serve. This should always be carried out in fellowship. We are not living under a dictatorship but are in an organic body which has an order.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 158.
