_For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. — Romans 8:29_ Unlike God’s choosing, being chosen in our human life does not automatically ensure our achieving the goal for which we were chosen. For instance, when I went to Taiwan University, I was among 180 students chosen for our proficiency in English. A selection board chose us but was unable to predestinate us. Thus, very few of us made much of a mark in the world. Our being chosen meant we could enter that school, but there was no guarantee that we would pass our classes, graduate from the program, or have a successful career. But God chose with a predestination! Our predetermined destiny is to be conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:29). We were predestinated unto divine sonship!
