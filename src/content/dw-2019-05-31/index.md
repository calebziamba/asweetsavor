_“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

When we first found genuine fellowship with our fellow seekers after the Lord, we also discovered that we were not the only one who loved the Lord, followed Him, and gave Him our all. Rather, many others were doing so as well. We turned from the individual enjoyment of the Lord’s love to a corporate enjoyment of the Lord’s love with all the other virgins.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, pages 24-25.
