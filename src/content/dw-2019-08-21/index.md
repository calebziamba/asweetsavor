_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

In contrast, making your own plaits is like having a weapon that is not real and is not suitable for battle; it cannot stand up to any kind of challenge from the things that come your way. Moreover, the younger ones whom you serve will imitate you to make their own plaits. Then, when Satan comes to attack, their plaits will also just fall down. Unless you have something divine woven into your being through the work of the cross, you will not be able to help them.

God allows Satan to test all of His works; He allows him to attack those upon whom He has worked. If the plaits of your hair are not made with God’s nature as the gold, then Satan will not seem to notice you. But just when you are willing to go on with the Lord a little, Satan will come to God to accuse you, and suddenly many things will happen. Do not be discouraged when this happens to you, for your experience through such difficult times will produce in you a golden crown.
