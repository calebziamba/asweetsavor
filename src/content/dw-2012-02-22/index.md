_Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him. — First Samuel 22:2_ God’s intention in saving us is not merely to rescue us from hell but that we might be one with Him for His purpose. God wants a people who are after His own heart, one with Him, ready to fight for His kingdom.

Only malcontents came to David, yet he was able to train them all. These became the base of his strength by which he raised up Judah and eventually all the kingdom of Israel. None of them were people of note. They were not graduates from the best universities, or the brightest stars in Israel. Therefore, tell those who are caring for you, “Please don’t say I am no good. I am in distress, in debt, and discontented. Train me that I might be a mighty man in God’s army!”

Such a group formed the core of David’s kingdom. Isn’t this encouraging? It was not those who seemed promising that David used to form the nucleus of his kingdom. It was those who were like us, those who were struggling just to make it.

You may feel you are in distress, in debt, or discontented, yet regardless of your feeling, you are qualified to be trained by the Lord Jesus Christ. He will receive you, and, if you allow Him, He will make you a mighty man able to fight for the sake of His kingdom.
