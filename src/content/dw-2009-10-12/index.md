_Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are. — John 17:11b_

_That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. — John 17:21_

The Lord has commissioned us to keep the oneness. This commission of keeping the oneness is closely related to the commission of loving one another. If we love one another as Christ has loved us, then in such a love we will be able to keep the oneness.

Today the Body of Christ is divided. Why is the Body divided? Because there is a shortage of this kind of love. Christians often love their doctrines and practices instead of their brothers and sisters. They would say, “I love the doctrines I believe, and you love the doctrines you believe. I love the practices I have, and you love the practices you have.” They don't realize that our new life causes us to be poured out upon our brothers and sisters.
