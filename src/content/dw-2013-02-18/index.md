_“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse;_ _A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:12_

In the Bible, God’s first thought was that of a garden—the Garden of Eden. When He created man, He planted a garden and put the man there to take care of it. There man could enjoy the milk and honey.

Alas! Adam and Eve failed and damaged God’s purpose. But, praise the Lord! In the one who stands in Christ’s ascension, man recovers what was lost, and God can testify, “How wonderful! I now have another Garden of Eden. My sister, my bride is like an enclosed garden.”
