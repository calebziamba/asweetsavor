_“While the king sat at his table,_  
_My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.”_  
_– Song of Solomon 1:12, ASV_

We need to remember that it is the seeker who says this, not the Lord. As we begin to experience the work of the cross, we may feel we have already learned a great deal. After a little dealing, we may immediately declare that our spikenard gives forth its fragrance. While this may be true, it is not yet the full fragrance. Furthermore, we see here that while the king is the object of the fragrance, the seeker hasn’t yet forgotten herself; she still feels that she is so precious and valuable. She testifies, “My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.” The Shulammite is still emphasizing herself and her own experience and is not yet completely lost in the Lord.
