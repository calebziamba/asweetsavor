_He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him._ _â€“ John 3:36_

Before we were born again we were poor, hopeless sinners, and as such we were in a miserable and desperate position. Now, however, we have nothing to do with where we were before, because God has transferred us into an entirely new position.
