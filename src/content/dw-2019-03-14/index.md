_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

In a father-child relationship, the father wants his child to grow well, so he endeavors to become a healthy pattern. This pattern is not just in outward behavior but in inward character. It is not just in his living and service, but in his decency, sobriety, and buoyancy. He displays a high understanding and apprehension of spiritual things.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 160.
