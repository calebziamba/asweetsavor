_And so it was, that when the bearers of the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. And David was dancing before the Lord with all his might, and David was wearing a linen ephod._ _— Second Samuel 6:13-14_

David, clothed in a linen ephod like the priests, accompanied the ark. It was as if he were saying, “I the king would like to be a priest too. Might I share in this privilege of accompanying the ark?” David stripped off his kingly garments and exchanged them for a priestly one. This was how he served the Lord that day.
