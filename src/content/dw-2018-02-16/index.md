_Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’”_ _– John 7:37-38_

In our Christian life, it is possible to be made alive and strengthened and yet still be thirsty. We need something that can refresh us. We need to drink something for our thirst to be quenched. The world has many kinds of “drinks” to quench our thirst, but as the Lord said, if we drink of these things we will thirst again (John 4:13). However, when we drink Christ Himself as the water of life, we are refreshed, and our thirst is truly quenched.
