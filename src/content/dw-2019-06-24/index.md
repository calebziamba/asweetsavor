_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

According to this verse, when the king draws “me”  
(singular) into His chambers, the result is that “we”  
(plural) “will exult and rejoice in you”; “we” (plural)  
“will extol your love more than wine.” Because we have had the experience of being in the Lord’s chambers, others are glad and rejoice in the Lord.
