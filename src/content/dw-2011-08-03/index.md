_“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.” — Joshua 1:2-3_

How glorious is such a life! It is immeasurably better than moaning about not having a job or being happy about having one. Every day thousands of people lose a job or gain one. I have loved the Lord Jesus for fifty-four years, and there has not been one period of time the Lord failed me. Everything on this globe can disappoint, but for the believer, Jesus is always precious and sweet.

What a life! This is why I can be happy even in the midst all kinds of turmoil. I may have tears, but within me is the assurance that there is One worthy of my trust. There is more of Christ to be gained in every challenge, so rise up and walk in Him!
