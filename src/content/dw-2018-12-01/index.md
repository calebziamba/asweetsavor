_But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know._ _– 1 John 2:20_

Our teaching should present a charge that results in a burden, causing people to live another kind of life. If this is the case, then our teaching is effective and we are true teachers. To be approved as Paul was, we must be such teachers.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 152.
