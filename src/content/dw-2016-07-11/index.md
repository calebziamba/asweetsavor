For the equipping of the personality to serve the Lord in His ministry, we must know these three things: the nature or disposition, the character, and the personality. When we believed in God, we received the divine nature, which transformed our created human nature. When we became a partaker of the divine nature, the divine nature entered into our human nature and produced a mingling of the two. Praise the Lord for this! Through the cooperation of a good character, this nature will produce a good personality.
