_"O my dove, In the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." â€” Song of Songs 2:14_

The rock is the Lord himself. The clefts of the rock are the place where we can be joined with the Lord.

When we first loved the Lord, the union between us was an affiliation of love, but it was not yet a true union. Here the Lord asks us to enjoy not only His love but also Himself. We need to be joined in union with Him. In this union we not only enjoy the riches of His love; we also experience what He has gone through.
