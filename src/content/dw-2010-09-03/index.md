_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

You may be attached to the world due to your weakness, but He will save you gradually until you are completely separated from the world. Thus the Lord will both constitute His life into you for His divine, golden expression and also work on you by the cross in order that you might experience His redemption. In this way, He will eventually make you His beloved bride who is able to really match Him.
