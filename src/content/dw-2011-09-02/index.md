This time, I took the test with my brother, who was five years younger than I. We knew someone who could notify us of our score a day before the public posting, so we waited by the phone at the arranged time. I answered it when it rang, and the person on the other end said, “Congratulations to your brother! He made it into Taiwan University.”

I then asked, “How about me?” He responded, “You were one point short.” At that moment I saw how real God was. My mother was upset at my failure, so the whole family had to act disappointed. However, I was rejoicing and singing songs to the Lord. My mother asked why I was so happy, and I told her that it was because the Lord was with me.
