Your words should also be in harmony with your own experience. You should not merely repeat some terms or give a message another person has given if you have no experience of what was spoken. What you share should be something in harmony with your own experience.

However, what we speak is typically higher than what we ourselves have experienced. This is particularly true for those who are just beginning to minister. We cannot limit ourselves just to the things we ourselves have experienced, for we do need to stretch ourselves. We still should have some understanding of what we are speaking about, even though it may be beyond our present experience. For example, when we talk about God's economy, we ourselves need to appreciate it and enter into it. The truth we release should not be something separate from our experience. What we share should be according to the principle of incarnation in the New Testament.
