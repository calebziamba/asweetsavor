_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

In the pleasing religious world where Christ and God are spoken of, God’s desire is actually frustrated. The religious world is as effective as the sinful world in causing people to become crooked and perverse. When people become involved with the lust of the eyes in the religious world, their conscience is darkened and their spirit is made dull.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 128.
