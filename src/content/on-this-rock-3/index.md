> And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
> 
> \- Matthew 16:18

We have to now come to the crucialness of the church: Christ desires to obtain "stones" like the "rock" to build His Church. Christ says, “You are Peter.” Peter is _petros_, which means "rock". In other words, He is saying, "You are a piece of rock. You are a piece of rock just like I am _the Rock_. And upon _this rock,_ I will build My church. You are also a piece of rock. I will make you a piece of rock to be built upon, just like Me. You will have the same nature, the same substance, and the same element, so that the church can be built up."
