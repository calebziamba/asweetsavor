_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

The experience of the King’s chambers is progressive. The more we have this experience, the more we are blessed. It is here that we touch the Lord and He touches us, that we enjoy Him and He enjoys us, and that we are with the Lord and He is with us. This intimacy is beyond words, and it is inexhaustible.
