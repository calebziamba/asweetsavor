_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

In this verse, Paul speaks of the “fellowship of the Spirit.” Encouragement and consolation come from being like-souled with our fellow believers, but fellowship of the Spirit comes from being one with the Spirit. In some Bible translations, Spirit is capitalized, indicating the divine Spirit. Other translations use the lowercase, indicating our human spirit. Our fellowship both with the Lord and with one another is a spiritual exercise.
