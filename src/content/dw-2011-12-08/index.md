_It happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with musical instruments. The women sang as they played, and said,_

_"Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands."_

_Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased him; and he said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?"_

_— First Samuel 18:6-8_ One day when David and Saul were returning from battle, the women came forth to sing their praises using tambourines and other instruments of music. This must have been a wonderful and joyous sight. They exalted David as the greatest fighter in Israel, even above Saul, singing, “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands” (1 Sam. 18:7). If only they had praised God instead of David, he would have been spared much suffering.

Many Christians exalt people instead of simply lifting up the Lord. This always leads to problems. The women’s excessive praise of David stirred Saul to jealousy, ushering in the next phase of David’s development—the persecution from Saul. The early period of manifestation was only the flowering stage; now, during the time of David’s sufferings, he would grow into a mighty tree.
