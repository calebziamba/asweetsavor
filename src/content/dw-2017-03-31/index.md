By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. – Hebrews 11:8

Although Abraham had the assurance that it was God who appeared to him, he was still not clear where God wanted him to go. “He went out, not knowing where he was going” (Heb. 11:8) and eventually came to the land of Canaan. God’s appearing does not always result in clarity. We follow the Lord beyond our reason.
