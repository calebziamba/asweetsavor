> Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new _man_ who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave _nor_ free, but Christ _is_ all and in all.
> 
> Colossians 3:9-11

If all that we see about the cross is suffering, then we will be short of its beauty. The full meaning of the cross was realized with Jesusâ€™ death. When He died, He issued in a whole new set of principles by which man and God encounter one another; He produced a New Creation.

In this message, brother Rex shares how the cross marked the termination of the Old Man, who was directed by God's governmental work, and was the germination of the New Man, who is directed by the nature of life within.

In a picture Rex illustrates from the writings of Watchman Nee, experience follows faith, and faith follows facts. If faith does not follow facts, then faith will fall and experience will follow.

The cross terminated the Old Man, led by the commands of God, and germinated the New Man, led by God walking with us and directing us by the nature of life within
