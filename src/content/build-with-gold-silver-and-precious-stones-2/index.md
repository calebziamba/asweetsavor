> Now if anyone builds on this foundation _with_ gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, [](http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm)each one’s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is.

> \- 1 Corinthians 3:12-13

When we use gold, silver, and precious stones to build upon it then God is very happy. So, what is gold? Gold is God Himself. Gold is the nature of God. What is silver? Silver is the redemption of Christ. We have God Himself. We have the redemptive work of Christ. Brothers and sisters, this is marvelous—not only am I saved, but I also have salvation. This salvation work within me changes my whole person. I am a person of Christ. I am saved from my disposition, from my temperament, from my talents, from my intellect, from my self-centered life—I am saved from all these. I have become a “man of silver,” so one with Christ and willing to give up everything for the Lord’s interests—for God’s interests.
