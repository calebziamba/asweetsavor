_“Refresh me with apples, For I am lovesick. His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me.” — Song of Songs 2:5-6_

As a result of her turn to the Lord, the seeker experiences satisfaction: “His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.” She is completely restful. In this position she can see only the Lord. She experiences the Lord not as her strength but as her satisfaction and rest in life. How sweet is this picture!
