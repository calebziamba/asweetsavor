> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> â€” Philippians 3:20 Darby

On that day when Christ brings the kingdom of the heavens to earth, knowledge will disappear, and only Christ Himself will be seen (1 Cor. 13:8). In our church life today, we should experience Christ as the testimony of the kingdom of the heavens on earth.
