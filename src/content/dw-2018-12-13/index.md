The second significant point about Isaac is that he was consecrated to God starting from the time his father offered him as a sacrifice. Even though Isaac was not entirely clear what was happening (Gen. 22:7), from that day he was consecrated to God. The New Testament tells us,

_For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf._ _– 2 Corinthians 5:14–15_

We died in Christ when He offered Himself on the cross. We were consecrated to God from that day. By faith, our position before God is one of consecration. We stand on the position of consecration, allowing God to work on us. When we declare our consecration to God, we are acting on faith, believing what Christ has already done.
