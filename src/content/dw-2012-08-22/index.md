_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

You may think that the Spirit works in you freely, at no cost to you. However, at a certain point in your Christian life, when you say, “Lord, bless me,” He will answer, “I will bless you, but at a price.”

In this stage, the way you live is by paying a price before God. You may think that it doesn’t matter whether you watch TV or read a novel, but you may find that God will only perfume you through your not reading the novel or not watching TV. If you are willing to pay a price, God will make you fragrant.
