_How blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah, Who walks in His ways. When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, You will be happy and it will be well with you. Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine Within your house, Your children like olive plants Around your table. Behold, for thus shall the man be blessed Who fears Jehovah Jehovah bless you from Zion, And may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life. Indeed, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel! — Psalm 128:1-6_

When a true servant of the Lord departs there is still a blessing for many generations. For example, Watchman Nee is gone, but we are his “children’s children.” We still love him and enjoy him. He was just like a vine tree and an olive tree. Brother Lee is the same. These two brothers are examples of men who became a real life supply, because they learned how to “sleep.” They learned how to fall into the ground and rest in the Lord’s hand. They became ones who could impart the oil and the wine. That is why they have been such a blessing. Their blessing will continue from generation to generation.
