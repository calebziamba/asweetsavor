_All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. —2 Timothy 3:16_

If you were to spend time to survey all the books being published today, you would discover that not many current preachers know their Bible. Instead, they are limited to their particular specialty. They may know 50 verses very well, or perhaps at most 80. Outside of their area of expertise, however, they don’t quite know the Bible.

Even if you are familiar with the facts of the Bible, however, you may not really know the Bible. In the early days among us, there were some who were really familiar with the Bible. However, not many possessed its revelation. Most know the facts, yet do not have revelation and vision.

All Scripture is God-breathed. When you touch the facts of the Bible, you must also touch the life within those facts. If you only study the facts without receiving life, the facts can become doctrines. As a result, you will not persistently read the Bible, nor will you be able to get into its depths. Delve deeply into it. If you really want to get into the Bible, you must touch the breath of God as well as the facts.
