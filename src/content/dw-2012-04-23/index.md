_“My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: Behold, he stands behind our wall; He looks in at the windows; He glances through the lattice. My beloved spoke, and said unto me, ‘Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away….’”_

_“Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.”

“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.”

_— Song of Songs 2:9-10, 17; 3:1_

Our God is serious and absolute. If He wants you, He will put you in His heart and in His hand and will work on you until He has completely gained you. Even the wonderful experiences of Christ we have already enjoyed cannot prevent the Lord from taking us on to the more wonderful experiences of Him that lie ahead of us.

He will definitely accomplish and achieve His desire. Although sometimes we are preoccupied with spiritual work, He is able to save us even from this, and He will give Himself to us when we turn to Him. He will be our uttermost enjoyment and satisfaction.
