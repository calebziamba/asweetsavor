> My God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus
> 
> \- Philippians 4:19

When we offer our money, God promises to fill our every need—whether spiritual, psychological, or physical. His promise to care for us also includes our financial needs. When a church learns to stand with the Lord’s servants in their affliction, its every need will be met according to God’s riches—who He is, what He has, all He has accomplished, and how He operates. I have never met a man who totally gave himself to Christ and eventually regretted it. I am thankful that the Lord has never been stingy with me. I hold nothing. I am afraid of nothing. I never give others the impression that I’m in need, even though I have experienced being down to my last dollar. When we learn to be responsible to Christ, especially in our finances, the Lord will meet our every need according to His riches.
