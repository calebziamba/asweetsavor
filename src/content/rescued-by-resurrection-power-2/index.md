Some may think of resurrection power as something that is extraordinary or supernatural. However, the normal operation of resurrection is applied to us in our daily life, including to our logic, our manner of life, and even the way we pursue the Lord. For instance, if the Lord leads us to speak something for Him, this resurrection power enables us to do so whether we feel we can or not. We are able to obey and follow the Lord because we all have this resurrection power. In all these things, resurrection power keeps bringing us back to Christ.
