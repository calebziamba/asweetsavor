This same brother also helped me later in my serving life. At one point, there was trouble brewing among the churches in Taiwan after a brother had visited there and given a conference. This brother who was caring for me set up a time with me. During that time, he said, “A brother I greatly respect once told me a story about Watchman Nee, saying that he seemingly didn't do something so well. Titus, what would you do if you were in my place? How would you react to this brother and his story?” My blood started to boil. I was tempted to say something, when that brother looked at me sternly and said, “Titus, it is none of your business.”

That word saved me. Many of the leading brothers at that time were siding with one brother against another. Had I not received this word, I might have become entangled and taken sides in the controversy. Instead, I was preserved. That storm lasted at least eight years. Do you know why I am still here? Because I had a “Naomi.”

After I came to the United States, Witness Lee became my “Naomi.” One day he found me reading a Chinese Bible and said, “Titus, are you still reading the Bible in Chinese?” In other words, I was in the United States, and I needed to develop my ability to use the English Bible. From that time on, I began to study many different editions of the English Bible. Eventually I learned from him something about the English translations and their comparative usefulness.
