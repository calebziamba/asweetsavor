> _When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was._
> 
> \- Matthew 2:9

Brothers, if the star was so high in the heavenlies, how could it lead them not only to Bethlehem, but even to the specific house Jesus was in? The star must have come lower and lower in their sight. What does this mean? It means that you must not despise the vision that you see. If you are faithful to the vision you see, that vision will become more and more intimate to you. The vision will become close to you; it will become near to you. The vision can lead you; it can even become the reality of your footsteps. In other words, you are able to go step by step because of that vision.
