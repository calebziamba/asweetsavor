_Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. — Ephesians 4:3_

_Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. — Ephesians 4:13_

_Abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments in ordinances,  that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace. — Ephesians 2:15_

The Greek word used for oneness in Ephesians 4:3 is _henotes_, the state of being one. In the entire New Testament this word is only used in this chapter, where it appears twice. Its first use is here, regarding the oneness of the Spirit. The second use is in verse 13, regarding the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.

The Greek word for one in Ephesians 2:15 (one new man) is _heis_, which refers to being one in nature and essence. _Henotes_ refers to the state or quality of being in one accord and being in harmony. Such oneness does not take away the distinctiveness of its members. Witness Lee indicates that this oneness is a unity without uniformity, a unity with diversity.
