> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> â€” Philippians 3:20 Darby

There is a divine administration in this heavenly commonwealth. Here, God in Christ is the government. He is its ruler. As citizens in this commonwealth, we follow Christ.
