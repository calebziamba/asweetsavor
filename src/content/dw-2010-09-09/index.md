Some Christians faithfully preach the gospel, then hold onto their converts as an asset. They display these converts in the meetings as living proof of their own Christian fruitfulness, forcing them to stand up and say something. Though such Christians are faithful to preach the gospel, they have no idea what God’s heart’s desire is, and those they bring to Christ are often not able to grow well.

Our Bible knowledge can be profitable to God, but it can also become our own personal Christian asset. If we use what we know for our own gain, we are not truly after God’s heart. I do not mean that we should not give ourselves to learn and be equipped. We should use every opportunity to study the Word and minister to others the light we receive. We should also lead people to Christ, shepherd them, and serve in our church. We should all be aggressive to learn these things. Every one of us must seek to become as profitable to the Lord as possible. If we are people after God’s heart, we will seek to use what the Lord has given us for His profit.
