_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

What does it mean to be saved by His life? It means to experience the ruling of God’s divine life within us. The life of God can operate in us as our king, leading and directing us in many situations.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 15
