_Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are....That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me._ _– John 17:11, 21_

As those who have been born again to become the members of the body of Christ, we should learn to enjoy the Lord’s life and grace together, and then we should love one another. This means that we should impart life to one another and pour ourselves out upon our fellow believers.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 100.
