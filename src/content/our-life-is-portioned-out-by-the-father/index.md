This message is part of the [Jesus Lovers' Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/) held January 16-18, 2009

In this session brother Titus goes over a hymn by Ann Waring, [“Father, I Know that All My Life”](https://www.hymnal.net/en/hymn/ns/12) using it to show, in a very practical way, what it means to be a lover of the Lord Jesus. For example, do we really understand that our life is “portioned out” by God our Father? If so, why do we fear changes? Such a fear indicates that we do not fully trust in the Lord.
