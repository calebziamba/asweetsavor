_“And I will make you a great nation,_ _And I will bless you,_ _And make your name great;_ _And so you shall be a blessing.”_ _–  Genesis 12:2_

God told Abraham, “I will make you a great nation” (Gen. 12:2). Eventually, when others saw him, they said, “You are a mighty prince among us” (23:6). They saw a nation in Abraham because the Lord reigned over him.
