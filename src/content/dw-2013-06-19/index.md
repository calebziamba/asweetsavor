_Slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful._ _– Romans 1:30-31_

On the one hand, a servant of the Lord should not focus on the work and neglect his family. On the other, he shouldn’t depart from the Lord for the sake of his family. He may disobey his parents in order to follow the Lord while loving his parents dearly. He may disagree with his family or even oppose them for the Lord’s testimony, while still really caring about them. For example, he will not listen to them when they tell him not to go to the meetings, not to love the Lord, or not to serve the Lord full-time. He will not yield in these things, although he indeed loves them.

We need the Lord’s mercy so that we may have the wisdom to pay attention to our humanity in order to have a proper, healthy living.
