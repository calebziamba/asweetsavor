_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _â€” Philippians 1:2_

The best illustration of grace is found in a family. When a father holds his child for the first time, his whole person becomes filled with grace. He has so much love that it is overflowing. In fact, whenever we are with those we are especially close to, we sense love, peace, and rest. This enjoyment is grace on a human level. The highest and truest grace is from our Lord Jesus. Grace means that Christ has come to us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 19-20.
