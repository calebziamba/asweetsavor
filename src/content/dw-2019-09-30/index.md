_Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob - Genesis 25:26_

Jacob’s main problem was that he was away from God. He had many precious experiences but without God Himself. As a result, his heart was insensitive, his ears were dull, and his eyes were dim. He was not clear about God or the things of God. Though he waved the banner of God, he didn’t have a direct, clear, and sweet relationship with God. He wandered in the spiritual world but didn’t realize that the root of spirituality is God Himself.

We need God’s mercy. We all are Jacobs. We are for self. In our natural man, we are selfish, struggling to prevail against God and men. We trust in the gifts, blessings, experiences, and talents that God gives us, but we don’t trust in God Himself. We don’t rely on Him. We must ask ourselves, do I have the presence of the Lord today? Has the Lord unveiled Himself to me? Has the Lord begun to transform me into His image? May the Lord open our eyes so that we see who we are and pursue Him.
