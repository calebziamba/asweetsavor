_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose._ _— Philippians 2:2_

Paul’s desire for the believers in Philippi was that they would be “of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose” (Phil. 2:2). When we are focused upon Christ, we think the same thing. Paul also stressed that we, in humility of mind, should regard one another as more important than ourselves (v. 3).
