"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

Consider the Lord’s teaching. His teaching gave life, and it conveyed God’s economy. However, His teaching did not lead Him into any kind of self-glory. Whenever people would begin to exalt Him or try to make Him king, He escaped immediately. He never departed from the principle, “I am a grain of wheat. I am a seed. I am ready to fall into the ground and die.”

In contrast, our teaching often fails to give life, or to convey God’s economy, but it does lead everyone to worship and appreciate us. Whenever we are manifested, whenever someone says that we are so good, we must be very careful. We must never allow a good report to lead us to self-glory. This is a principle.
