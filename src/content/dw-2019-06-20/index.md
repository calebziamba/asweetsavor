_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

The love between the Lord and us is not for us to show to others or to brag about. Rather, we should always have a secret life of being in love with the Lord. We should have something that is just between the Lord and us and not for anyone else, a secret fellowship with the Lord, experiences with Him that we cannot open to others. Such experiences are something special and are not to be revealed; rather, they must remain hidden.
