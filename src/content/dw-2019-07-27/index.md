_“For why should I be like one who veils herself_ _Beside the flocks of your companions?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

Although the seeker feels that she is wandering because of her perplexity in the church life, she doesn’t lose sight of the most important thing: focusing on her relationship with the Lord, and on her nourishment and rest in Him, rather than on her work. The seeker is still regulated by her experience in verses 2 and 3. The Lord has attracted her and captured her by His beauty. Apart from Him, she realizes she cannot have nourishment or rest. Although her attitude about serving has caused her to wander, she is still able to go on because of her desire for the Lord. If not for this, her Christian life might stop at this point.
