_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. —Philippians 2:16_

_I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus._ _—Philippians 3:14_

As athletes run a race, they forget everything around them and focus only on the goal, for everything is geared to winning. In the Christian race, we cannot allow anything to hinder us. We must avoid distractions, for our desire is to gain the top blessing—Christ Himself.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 133.
