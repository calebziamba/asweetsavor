_To You I lift up my eyes, O You who are enthroned in the heavens! Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the Lord our God, Until He is gracious to us. — Psalm 123:1-2_

Psalm 123 shows us that we who love the Lord in the church life are actually “servants” and “maidens” of the Lord. We are those who pay attention to the Lord's hand. This is true consecration. Our consecration to the Lord should not merely be in a prayerful or theoretical way. We should consecrate ourselves practically to the Lord in our actions and behavior. We should not tell the Lord, “Lord, I give myself to You,” and then go back to live our own life and take care of our own things. Once we tell the Lord, “I give myself to you,” then our whole person is focused on paying attention to the Lord Himself. We are utterly aware of our “master's hand.” We are focused on all of His dealings and actions.

This is the reality of consecration. It is not a theory or a slogan, nor is it merely a proper position. When a person has the reality of consecration it means that they are fully attentive to the actions of the Lord Himself. If we are truly consecrated, then however the Lord leads and whatever the Lord does, we are those who have the proper response to Him. As the “servants” and “maidens” of the Lord we must learn to be so attentive to “the hand of our master.”
