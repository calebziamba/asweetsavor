Eventually we will see that, like Isaac, the Lord intends for us to be in the center of His plan. He chose us, and we are consecrated to Him. We are the heirs of all of our Father’s riches. The Lord faithfully leads us forward. We can see His love from the beginning to the end, as one hymn says,

_God’s compassion is my story,_  
_Is my boasting all the day;_  
_Mercy free and never failing_  
_Moves my will, directs my way._  
_God so loved us, God so loved us,_  
_That His only Son He gave,_  
_That His only Son He gave._  
_– From a hymn tr. by Francis P. Jones_
