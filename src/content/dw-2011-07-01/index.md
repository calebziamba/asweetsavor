_So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all are yours. — First Corinthians 3:21-22._

I do not know how many are able to sincerely say this. Paul, however, was very clear that all the serving ones belong to the saints. Paul realized that no matter how rich his ministry was, it was only a part of the New Testament ministry. In other words, Paul is yours, John Nelson Darby is yours, Watchman Nee is yours, and Witness Lee is yours. Whether in the east or the west, in the past, present, or future, all the manifested servants are yours.

You should have the feeling whenever you see any serving one: “I am so happy he is mine!” You are not theirs; they are yours. Therefore do not say, “I am of somebody,” for that somebody is for you.
