_"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same  
things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you."  
\- Philippians 3:1  
_

This is what a Christian life should be. We are one with Christ in life, we are being mingled with Him in nature, and even more, we must experience being incorporated with Him in person.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 178.
