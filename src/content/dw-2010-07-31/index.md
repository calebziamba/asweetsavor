_Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."_

_And Moses built an altar and named it “The Lord is My Banner.” — Exodus 17:14-15_ Joshua had a very good beginning. He was committed to the Lord, and he gave himself to fight. His victory, however, was dependent upon others fighting behind the scenes. He learned to be watchful, for something will always rise up to rob the Lord of His rightful honor. One day, this robbing enemy will be utterly blotted out. Until that time of complete victory, the Lord remains Joshua’s banner.
