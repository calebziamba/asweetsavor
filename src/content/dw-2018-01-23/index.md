_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

It is God’s mercy for us if we respond to the Lord’s call as Rebekah did here! Others may think we are foolish for giving our lives to the Lord, but we would say, “I am willing to give everything to gain the best!” We give ourselves to the Lord because the Holy Spirit has revealed Him to us. He has shown us how rich Christ is and how worthy He is. When we see this, spontaneously we “count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ” (Phil. 3:8).
