The Greek word of remembrance (1 Corinthians 11:24-25) is _anamnesis_, which means to repetitiously recollect and remember someone or something in a renewing way. Apostle Paul used its family words in 2 Timothy 1:3-6 (for a brother) and in Philippines 1:3-7 (for a church).

## **1 Corinthians 11:24–25**

_1 Cor. 11:24  and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”_

_1 Cor. 11:25  In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”_

In this passage Paul showed us that our Lord desired His believers to co-participate in Him and His redemption by blood and His salvation by life through “eating His body” and “drinking His blood”. The whole participation process is for remembrance  (Gk., _anamnesis_) of Him, which remembrance is to set our heart on Him, His purpose, His life and His work for His believers and His church. This remembrance of Him will affect our personal life, our family life and our church life and makes us His lovers for His satisfaction and His partners for His church and His fighters for His kingdom all our life.

The apprehension of “in remembrance of the Lord“ is in our spirit and our renewed mind; the application of “in remembrance of the Lord“  is in our participation in Him and His accomplishments. The practice of “in remembrance of the Lord“ is in our living and work; The demonstration of  “in remembrance of the Lord“ is in the Lord’s table.

## **2 Timothy 1:3–6**

_2 Tim 1:3  I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day._

_2 Tim 1:4  As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy._

_2 Tim 1:5  I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well._

_2 Tim 1:6  For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands;_

This epistle is the personal letter of Paul to Timothy, his genuine child. After Paul chose him as his young learner and companion for his ministry, Paul continued to raise him up by leading him, equipping him and perfecting him.  They both are co-participants in the gospel preaching, the pioneering of new cities and the establishing of existing churches.

This passage shows us the real care of Paul for Timothy based on their close discipleship and partnership. Paul remembered (Gk., _mneia_) him constantly in his prayers night and day. He remembered (Gk., _mimnesko_) his tears and longed to see him. He was reminded of (Gk., _hupomnesis)_ his sincere faith. Moreover, he reminded (Gk., _anamimnesko_) him to rekindle the gift of God in him. This is how a spiritual father raises up his spiritual child!

## **Philippians 1:3–7**

_Phil. 1:3  I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,_

_Phil. 1:4  always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy,_

_Phil. 1:5  because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now._

_Phil. 1:6  And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ._

_Phil. 1:7  It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart (or, you hold me in your heart), for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel._

Out of all the churches raised up by Paul, The church in Philippi was one of the few churches who was so intimate and supportive to Paul and his ministry. They are Paul’s comfort and joy. In the book of Philippians you can tell how close their relationship is with Paul. Paul desired to stay on the earth for their growth in faith. If he was martyred, his martyrdom would become a drink offering being poured on their sacrifice of faith. 

In this passage Paul was full of thanks to God by his remembrance (Gk., _mneia_) of the church in his prayers because of their partnership with Paul in the service of the gospel, which is a good work begun and completed by the Lord. Their joint participation with Paul of grace in his imprisonment and his gospel service caused Paul to hold them in his heart and caused them to hold Paul in their heart. What a wonderful picture of mutual remembrance between the apostle and the church!
