> or indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; while yet we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.

> \- 2 Corinthians 5:4

How do you groan? You just pick the deepest thing from your heart. As I groan my whole person is washed, regardless how sinful I am, how dead I am, how frustrated I am, or how limited I am. I encourage you all, especially the older saints, to learn to kneel and, out of all your physical weakness, groan before the Lord.
