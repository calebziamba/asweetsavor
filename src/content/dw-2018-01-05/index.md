_“All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes of Mine and will disclose it to you.”_ _– John 16:15_

Before we were saved, we may have had some knowledge of God as the Creator (Rom. 1:19–20) but very little knowledge of Christ. Then the Holy Spirit testified of the greatness of God and unveiled to us the Lord Jesus, the beloved Son of God.

All the riches of God belong to Him. The more the Spirit speaks to us concerning the Son, the more attractive and valuable He becomes to us. Eventually we have eyes for no one but the Lord. He is enough for us. Who else do we need? To outsiders, it may seem pathetic that we only have the Lord without any future in the world, not even in the religious world. To us, however, the Lord is enough, for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col. 2:9)
