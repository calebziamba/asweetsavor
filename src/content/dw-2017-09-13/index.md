_“I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be blameless.”_ _– Genesis 17:1_

The original Hebrew for “God Almighty” is _El Shadday_. Concerning this title, Gridlestone writes, “While the name _El_ sets forth the might of God, the title _Shadday_ points to the inexhaustible stores of His bounty.”

The Almighty God is all-bountiful. It was after Abraham failed by having Ishmael that God revealed Himself to him as the All-bountiful God and told him to be blameless. Being blameless before God is not based on our victory but on our knowing of our own faults and knowing God as the All-bountiful One.
