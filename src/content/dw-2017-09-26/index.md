_Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”_ _– Genesis 17:17_

We only need God Himself. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we are not able to give up on the Lord or try to accomplish on our own what He has committed to us. We dare not say we can or cannot do it. We can only bow down and sigh, “I need Your mercy, Lord.” We cannot believe, but we cannot leave, either. This is the reality of faith.
