> And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what _is_ that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
> 
> \- Romans 12:2, NKJV

You need to be transformed. Transformed so your mind is renewed. You begin to know what the will of God is, what God desires, what God’s economy is, what God’s eternal purpose is, and what God wants to accomplish. One day, your will matches that will (God’s will)!
