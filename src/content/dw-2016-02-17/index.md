_Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God._ _– Romans 3:19_

To some people, it may not matter whether they are in God’s kingdom or not, but it certainly does matter to God. Thus, He gave the Law to expose man’s sinful and unrighteous condition and to bring the world under His judgment. Before we were born again we were, like all other unsaved human beings, under God’s righteous judgment.
