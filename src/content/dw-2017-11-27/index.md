_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

The Greek word for “perverse” here is _diastréphô_, which means “to turn aside from the right path, to pervert, corrupt” (Thayer, p. 142). Why is it that so many believers cannot grow well spiritually? It is because they are under the influence of this generation, which causes them to become crooked and perverse.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ,](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; page 125.
