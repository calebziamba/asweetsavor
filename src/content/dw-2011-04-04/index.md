_I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints. — Ephesians 1:18_

What God desires is His inheritance in the saints, but this inheritance will not be gained without a fight. This is why Ephesians 6 tells us to put on the whole armor of God (vv. 11–17).  The armor of God enables us to stand against the wiles of the devil (Eph. 6:11).

To put on the armor of God practically means to put on the church life. We should not say that the Lord Jesus alone is our armor, for we cannot divide the body of Christ from Christ (Rom. 12:4–5). Christ and Christ’s body are one (1 Cor. 12:12). In this one entity we can put on Christ. When we put on Christ, we put on the body of Christ; when we put on the body of Christ, we put on all the members of the new man (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10; cf. 1 Cor. 12:15–26). Every member needs to put on the other members, and altogether we need to put on Christ (Rom. 13:12–14).
