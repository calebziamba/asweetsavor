You must realize that what seems to be your hindrance and shortage today can be used by the Lord to build up the church in the future. Today your prudence or righteousness or persistence may be a limitation, but in the future the Lord can use these traits to build up the church. Your nature wonâ€™t be stripped away, for it is from the Lord. Instead, Christ will increase in your nature through the work of God.
