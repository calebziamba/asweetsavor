_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

In fact, we often make plaits using the gift God has given us, so that others would notice our capability to carry out spiritual work or to minister in the church. Such service is superficial. But although we make others think that we are very gifted, this does not bother God. He simply brings us to the cross so that what is really of Him might be worked into us.
