_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

Those who know how to stand with what the Lord is doing in the church life and in their environment become “blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach” (Phil. 2:15). The Greek word for “innocent” here is _kéraios_, meaning unmixed, unadulterated, pure, and sincere (Rienecker, p. 552).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; pages 123-124.
