_“Walk before Me and be blameless” – Genesis 17:1_ God was Abraham’s portion, and He is also our portion as His called ones. The gaining of God as the called ones’ portion has a principle, a process, a manifestation, and a result.

There is a principle to the gaining of God. If we live according to this principle, we will be in the right position to gain God as our portion. Otherwise, it is easy for us to fall into religion, substituting our own concepts for the reality of God Himself as our portion. According to the experience of Abraham, the first item of this principle is to know God as our shield and reward.
