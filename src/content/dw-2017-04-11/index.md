_The Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him._ _– Genesis 12:7_

“Shechem” means “the neck (between the shoulders) as the place of burdens” (Strong, no. 7926), which is a place of strength. In Shechem, God appeared to Abraham and promised him, “To your descendants I will give this land” (Gen. 12:7). This was God’s first provision for Abraham, which strengthened him to build an altar to the Lord. When God appears and speaks to us, without even knowing it we are strengthened to walk the way of God.
