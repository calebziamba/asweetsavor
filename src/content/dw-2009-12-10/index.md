_“Go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.” — Ruth 3:3b_

Many believers never experience a consecration that is between themselves and the Lord alone. They spend hours talking on the phone but have very little communication with the Lord. Furthermore, they are pushy and insistent with the Lord. Rather than patiently allowing Him to have His enjoyment first, they complain, whine, and insist that the Lord do something for them immediately. In this deeper consecration, however, it is the Lord who has become the center, not we ourselves.
