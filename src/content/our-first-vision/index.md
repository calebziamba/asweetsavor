> I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord
> 
> – 2 Corinthians 12:1 (NKJV)

Brothers, none of you can say “I never had any vision.” At least you’ve had one vision, and that’s why you are saved. If you did not see something, how could you have believed in Jesus Christ? You never saw Him in person. I can tell you there was a man on the earth who died for us two thousand years ago, and today, He is resurrected, He is in the heavenlies, and He is the King of kings. Brothers, how can a man’s mind receive anything like this? Based on man’s logic, such reception is impossible. But surprisingly, we all believed. Why did we believe? Because God had given us a vision. Th ere was one time, a particular time, when for some reason our heart was softened. In our deepest part, we had the realization, “I need Jesus Christ, my Savior.”
