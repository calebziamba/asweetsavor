_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?”_

_“My beloved extended his hand through the opening,_ _And my feelings were aroused for him.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:3-4_

When the Lord reveals His hand to us, our hearts melt and we fall down before Him. It seems that we suddenly wake up. We thought we were His bed and His palanquin. We thought that wherever we went, people were blessed. Now we repent to the Lord for all these circumstances. We thought all this was the result of our labor. Now we realize that we shouldn’t dwell on these things. We also realize that our past willingness to go to the mountain of myrrh was for gaining the glory of men.
