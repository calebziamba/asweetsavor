> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
> 
> – Philippians 4:7 (ESV)

Whenever we touch the Lord in prayer, everything is fine. If we are anxious, that surely indicates Christ is not involved in what we are doing. We may have our idea of why we should or should not do something, and we may even pray according to those thoughts, but once we touch the Lord, we are touching the One who has a plan that is greater than ours. As we pray and petition the Lord, this One who has the understanding that is higher than ours knows how to work with us. Eventually we become so thankful that everything is in the Lord’s hands. This is when we really experience the peace of God.
