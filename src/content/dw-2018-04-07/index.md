_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. —Philippians 2:16_

Paul realized that the Christ he pursued would become the Christ that others would enjoy. He wouldn’t meet the Lord just by himself; he would meet the Lord together with all those who had pursued and gained Christ because of him (1 Thess. 2:19–20).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 134.
