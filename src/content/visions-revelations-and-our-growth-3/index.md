> Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 12:1

We must understand, our growth is not by nature or talent. It is not by our personal abilities. Itâ€™s not by our wisdom or our brightness. What is crucial is being faithful to God-given visions and revelations.
