_“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

Those who have not touched the Lord can only do such things as gossip and reason together. In contrast, those who have touched the Lord can not only touch Him; they are also able to touch others’ love toward the Lord.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 24.
