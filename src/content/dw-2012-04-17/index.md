My first field of labor in the church life was serving the children. I began as a teacher but eventually became the leader of the childrenâ€™s service, responsible for training others. Every week each teacher had to do some homework, read the Bible, and grow in the spiritual life. They even had to come together to demonstrate how they would teach their lesson, as well as testify how they had been living before the Lord. Due to that process a number of good teachers were raised up. That is a field.
