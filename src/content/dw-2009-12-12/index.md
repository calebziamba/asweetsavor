_“It shall be when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do.” — Ruth 3:4_ When I was young, I gave myself to the Lord for the church. Today, I am in the church life for the Lord. Eventually we all must be able to say, “Lord, I love You. I am only following You. Where You lie down, I lie down at Your feet. I am not worthy, nor am I qualified. It is all Your mercy.”
