> And having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, highly favored _one,_ the Lord _is_ with you; blessed _are_ you among women!”
> 
> \- Luke 1:28, NKJV

Mary saw this vision. It begins with a heart warming greeting: “Rejoice, highly favored one!” In other words, "Be joyful!" Joyful is different from happiness. Man focuses on attaining happiness, but God’s desire is for joyfulness. Happiness can be outward: the kids can be happy with a toy, a young person can be happy with a car, a mature person can be happy with a nice house; but in them all, the happiness comes and goes. What is real is the inward joy. Joyfulness is from the Greek word _chario_ which means "full of grace". Why are you joyful? Because grace is here.
