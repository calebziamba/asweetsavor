For our service to be fruitful and effective, we need to shepherd and labor with burden. When others are with us, they should be comforted and feel hopeful; they should be helped to grow and develop. They should be inspired by us. Because of us, they should feel that the church life is worthwhile and that a life of serving the Lord is very meaningful. Their level of life must become so strong that their understanding and manner of life begin to change. If lives are being changed due to our service, this is an indication of our approvedness.
