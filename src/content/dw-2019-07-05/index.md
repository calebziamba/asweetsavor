_“Rightly do they love you.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:4_

Brothers and sisters, I have a heavy burden. May God have mercy upon us to open our eyes! May we see how the church needs virgins who rightly love the Lord! Such saints have no plans for their future and are not interested in any position in the church. They don’t want anything for themselves; they simply focus on the Lord. If He says, “Stop,” they stop. If He says, “Go,” they go. If He says, “Pay the price,” they pay the price. If He says, “Leave all,” they leave all. Because they rightly love the Lord, every other consideration and expectation is laid aside.
