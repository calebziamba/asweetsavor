_Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is._ _– 1 John 3:2_

The glorification of Christ as the Firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29) means that we will become the same as He is. We are being conformed to His image. In other words, He is the pattern for what we are becoming. Someday we will all be exactly the same as this wonderful Christ is today (1 John 3:1–2).

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 78.
