_He blessed him and said,_

_“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,_ _Possessor of heaven and earth;_ _And blessed be God Most High,_ _Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”_ _– Genesis 14:19-20_

Only God’s authority can make us overcomers. As we walk in Christ as our promised good land and partake of His provision of fellowship, we exercise God’s authority which enables us to live an overcoming life.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 96.
