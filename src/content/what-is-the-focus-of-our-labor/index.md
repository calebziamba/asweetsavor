In this segment, brother Titus refers to Psalm 84:7, which states "Each one of us must appear before God", that is, each of us must have our own personal experience of Christ. He also refers to the Old Testament picture of the tabernacle, which shows us that, while the outer court is necessary, we must not remain there. Rather, in our seeking after God we must go on to enter into the tabernacle to experience Christ directly. So often, in our care for the saints, we only bring them to the meetings, which is the outward form of the church life, and not into the real experience of Christ himself
