> Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
> 
> \- Joshua 1:9

You see, His presence will never go. His presence will never go because He is the pneuma. The pneuma is in every place. Where is there no air? You cannot go to the mountain to avoid Him, and you cannot go to the valley. You cannot get away from Him. What we need to exercise--to learn--is to be covered with the presence.
