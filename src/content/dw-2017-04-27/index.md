_The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran._ _– Genesis 11:32_

As we follow the Lord, it is easy for us to rely on natural things and natural abilities. Praise the Lord for His discipline. If we rely on our own schemes, God will discipline us to teach us to rely only on Himself.
