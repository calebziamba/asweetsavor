_But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition._  
_– Philippians 2:19_

Timothy’s ability to become an encouragement to the apostle Paul qualified him to be an approved coworker with Paul.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")
