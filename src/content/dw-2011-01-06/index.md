_Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, “Send out for yourself men so that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give to the sons of Israel; you shall send a man from each of their fathers' tribes, every one a leader among them." — Numbers 13:1-2_

In order to take the land, they needed to know what to expect. Joshua was selected to be one of these twelve.

Moses told them, “Go up this way into the South, and go up to the mountains” (v. 17). Whenever we follow the Lord, we are ascending. The Christian life is always taking us higher. There is no way to progress as a believer and remain at the same spiritual altitude. We may be happy to remain on a plateau, but the Lord is not. His intention is that we would ascend. After we ascend to a new height and feel so glorious, the Lord still says, “Don’t stop now! Ascend further!”
