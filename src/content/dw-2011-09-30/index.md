_When the disciples had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. — Matthew 17:8

Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the fields of Jaar. Let us go into His tabernacle; Let us worship at His footstool. Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. — Psalm 132:6-8_

As we have said before, when the reality of God’s habitation is produced, the “I” disappears and there is no one but Christ.

Even though these matters are deep, we should still have at least some understanding of what is revealed here. We need to pray, “Oh Lord, I give myself to You that I would become fully mature. I want my house to be Your tabernacle, and Your tabernacle to be my house. I want my life and the church life to be one, to the fullest degree possible. And even more, Lord, I desire to produce the substance and reality of the church life. I desire that we would have Your heavenly ruling, Your resurrection power, and Your divine life supply. I pray, Lord, that by my exercise in maturity You could enter into Your rest.”
