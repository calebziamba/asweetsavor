_“Until the cool of the day When the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense.” — Song of Songs 4:6_

As we read the Song of Songs, we find that a lover of God has a seeking heart. We should always feel that we are not perfected yet. Even though we may have loved the Lord for many years, we should still realize that we are lacking in the experience of life. We should feel that we still need much of the Spirit’s work. We should not be satisfied until we have reached the wonderful manifestation that the Lord desires.
