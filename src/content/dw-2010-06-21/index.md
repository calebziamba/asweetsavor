_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

_Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord; O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. — Psalm 130:1-2_ The beginning of Psalm 130 follows from the previous psalm. Whenever we experience the Lord’s plowing work through our environment, we become a person of prayer.

We are not this way by nature. We prefer to be wild and unrestricted and usually don’t feel the need to pray. But when we go through a trial, or when something drastic happens, then we become a prayerful person. We are driven to the Lord. We call on the Lord “out of the depths.” Because of our affliction we pray, “O Lord, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.”
