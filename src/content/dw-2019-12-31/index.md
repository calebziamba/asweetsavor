_“I am the rose of Sharon,  
 The lily of the valleys.”  
– Song of Songs 2:1  
_

We also see here that what God seeks is a rose of Sharon, not an orchid in a pot. Do you know the difference? If you are like an orchid in a pot, although you may have experienced some work of the Lord, you still need to be tended to by other saints; otherwise, you will wither. A rose of Sharon, however, needs no such special attention.

Moreover, if you are like a rose of Sharon, you will not strive with other saints, for you will realize that all of the believers are equally common. It is wrong to consider yourself as someone with higher revelation or with more maturity in life. We need to be able to tell the Lord, “Lord, I am nobody special in the church life. I am just like others.
