When life is growing in us, we are more sensitive to our prudence, our righteousness, or our persistence.Â  To be prudent is good, as is to be righteous. As for persistence, no one can accomplish much without it. But in order to be flexible in our persistence, we need the work of the Spirit. The Spirit has to work in us so that we have the sense of life and the awareness of life regarding our character.
