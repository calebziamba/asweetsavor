_That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit._ _– John 3:6_

We may think that God, who is the object of our worship, has nothing to do with us. Rather, because He is so high and we are so low, we must bow down before Him. Yet, in this verse Jesus is telling us something very different. He is saying that God is Spirit, and we must worship Him in spirit. The result of such worship is that the two spirits—God the Spirit and our human spirit—become one, for genuine worship brings the Spirit and our spirit together (cf. 1 Cor. 6:17).
