> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.

Prayer stresses fellowship, while supplication refers to intercession for a particular matter. Prayer leads to supplication,  
and supplication generates prayer. They both end up with thanksgiving.

If we want to carry out the Lord’s move and work, we must be in fellowship with Him through prayer. As we spend time in His presence, certain specific matters will come up in our heart, and we will begin to petition the Lord concerning these matters. If we practice this kind of prayer, what the Lord desires will be worked out among us.
