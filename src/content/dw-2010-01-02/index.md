_Then he said, “May you be blessed of the Lord, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich. Now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence.” — Ruth 3:10-11_

Boaz had already blessed Ruth by supplying her needs. Based upon that, Ruth had matured, but she still needed to take another step. Under Naomi’s wise care, she found Boaz and entered into a relationship with him in which he became her center. No longer was she merely dependent upon him for some supply. From now on, she would learn to know him as her center and her everything, moving when he moved, being joined to him to bring forth something for his heart’s desire.
