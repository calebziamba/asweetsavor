_"Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.  
When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket  
of his thigh; so the socket of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated while he  
wrestled with him...and he was limping on his thigh"  
\-Genesis 32:24-25, 31  
_

We are full of our own ways and plans. We don’t trust God. We rely on our abilities, our talents, and the things that God has given us. We look to Him but trust ourselves. May God raise up all the right environments for our natural abilities to come to an end. Only after we have tried everything and still feel weak and unable will we realize that without God’s mercy we cannot go forward.
