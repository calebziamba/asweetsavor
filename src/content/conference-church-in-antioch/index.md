> _And when he found Paul, Barnabas brought him to Antioch. And it happened with them that for a whole year they were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number and that the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch._

> _â€” Acts 11:26_

_These are the complete messages given by Titus Chu during January 1 - 5, 2007 in a training with brothers and sisters from around the Great Lakes._

While we may appreciate the wonderful experience of the church in Jerusalem as recorded in the first few chapters of Acts, it is the church in Antioch, and not the church in Jerusalem, that is the pattern of a healthy church life today.

According to the New Testament record, within a few years of the great outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem the church there became mired in a religious system, to the point that the Lord could no longer work with the brothers there to carry out His move. Thus, the Lord took another step, and began anew by raising up the church in Antioch.

We cannot repeat the miraculous experience in Jerusalem, but the church in Antioch shows brothers coming together in a marvelous way to carry out and spread the Lord's testimony on the earth. Surely this is what the Lord is seeking after in these days as well; may we render Him our full cooperation in this matter!

**_Note: Because brother Titus was ill during this conference, most of the messages were given by his co-workers using outlines brother Titus had prepared._**
