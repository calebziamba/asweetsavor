_Until the cool of the day When the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense. — Song of Songs 4:6_

She has come to the realization that only by means of fellowship in the Lord’s death and resurrection can she go though all the difficulties, and only by means of the work of the cross can she become God’s satisfaction. Not until then will she be a testimony in the church and a lover before the Lord.

She realizes that her relationship with the Lord no longer relies primarily upon reading the Bible, going to some meetings, or just praying some sweet prayers. Now she sees that she needs to pay a price in order to continue on in her love relationship with the Lord. It is because of this that she wants to go to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.

Our chief desire should be to experience the Lord in His death and resurrection. May we all pray, “Lord, I too want to go to the mountain of myrrh. I don’t want to treasure my gift. The blessings I held before are now forsaken. I desire to go to the mountain of myrrh.” Only those who abide in the mountain of myrrh will truly experience the riches of God and express Christ’s resurrection life, as represented by the hill of frankincense.
