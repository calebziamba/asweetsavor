If we are to be equipped for the ministry, we must have the equipping of our personality.

Before we talk about personality, we should understand the difference between personality, character, and disposition. The meaning of “disposition” is closely related to the meaning of the term “nature,” although nature is inborn and disposition is something acquired. The word “nature” is used in 2 Peter 1:4, “That…you might become partakers of the divine nature.” Brother Lee often used the word “disposition” when referring to the constitution of the inborn nature plus its cultivation.
