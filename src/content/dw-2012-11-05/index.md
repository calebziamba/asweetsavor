"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

As a man on the earth the Lord was prepared to die. However, He also expected that through His death He would bear much fruit. This is why He could be joyful in His spirit. He knew that the Father’s will was for Him to fall into the ground and die, and then to bear much fruit. We must learn from His example in this regard.
