How can we enter into a living of enjoying God? The Bible reveals that there is a way, and that way is the Spirit. John 16:13 begins,

_When He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth...._

In this verse, and throughout John’s writings, the word “truth” does not refer simply to that which is correct or factual. Rather, it has the deeper meaning of “reality.” Therefore, we may also speak of the Spirit as “the Spirit of reality.” What will bring us into the reality of the enjoyment of Christ? It is the Spirit of truth, the Spirit of reality.
