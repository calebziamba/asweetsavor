_"So Jacob named the place Peniel, for he said, "I have seen  
God face to face, yet my life has been preserved.""  
\- Genesis 32:30  
_

After Peniel, Jacob had a different feeling toward God. Previously he knew God as the One who gave him grace, blessed him in every situation, and could be bargained with. Now he feared God. He began to know Him as the Lord of life. Though he might harden his heart and forget his consecration, he knew God would keep working on him according His plan. His knowledge of God advanced.
