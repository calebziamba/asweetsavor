_And when a man came near to Absalom to prostrate himself before him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. In this manner Absalom dealt with all Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole away the hearts of the men of Israel. – Second Samuel 15:5-6

_Absalom quickly used his restored princely status to work against his father (2 Sam. 15). He sat at the gate and met with the people before they went to David and told them, “Oh, that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has any suit or cause would come to me; then I would give him justice” (v. 4). Absalom stole the people’s hearts away from his father, the king.
