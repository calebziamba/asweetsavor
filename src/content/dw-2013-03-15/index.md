_Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.” Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the Lord is with you.” – Second Samuel 7:1-3_

Whether or not David built God such a place, God would be with His people. Though God didn’t need a temple, He still appreciated that David was ready to act out of his love for Him. This is like a young girl telling her father, “Daddy, I’m going to buy you an ice cream cone!” Her father appreciates that she is considering his happiness, even though her offer is unnecessary.

We can never overdo loving the Lord. He is happy when we give ourselves to please Him, even though what we do for Him may be unnecessary.
