_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._  
_– Philippians 1:1_

_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father._  
_– Philippians 2:22_

Timothy served with Paul as a child with a father in a sweet relationship that was founded on Christ and grew in Him. However, this relationship was not an end in itself. As a father and child, Paul and Timothy served together in the gospel, laboring together for the fulfillment of God’s purpose.
