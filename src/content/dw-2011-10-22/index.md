_Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel. — Philippians 1:26_

The saints in Philippi enjoyed a oneness with the apostle Paul. As those who had him in their heart, they were waiting for him and longing for his arrival. And since they were struggling with him in the same struggle and had him in their heart, the apostle would certainly come to them. They were waiting for that day, and his coming to them would be the fulfillment of their expectation.

Before that day, they were already somewhat experiencing the apostle’s presence (parousia), as one who was in their heart. Eventually, however, his physical appearing would issue in a fullness of joy that would be enjoyed between the apostle and the saints. In the apostle’s arrival, the saints’ boasting would thus abound.
