> I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord
> 
> – 2 Corinthians 12:1 (NKJV)

There was one time, a particular time, when for some reason our heart was softened. In our deepest part, we had the realization, “I need Jesus Christ, my Savior."

Who made it happen? Th e Lord did. How did He do it? He gave you a vision to see that Jesus Christ is your Savior. Now, your whole life goes on based on this vision. When you received Jesus Christ as your Savior into your inner being, He came into you, and He became your life. Now, are you able to grow, to develop, to become His lover, to become useful to Him? These are all based on how faithful you are to the first vision.
