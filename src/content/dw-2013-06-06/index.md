Some know nothing about the human life. They can do everything without complaint in the face of any hardship and criticism, but they have no idea about proper human living. When they serve a church, the saints really suffer. They are very godly, but do not necessarily have the presence of the living Christ.

They don’t understand that the saints need peace and rest. They know nothing about the needs of human life. Their sincerity turns them into religious workers, since they don’t have the living Christ, the Lord’s presence, or the leading of the Spirit.
