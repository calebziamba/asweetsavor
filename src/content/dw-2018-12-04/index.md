_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

Abraham essentially received no inheritance. Regarding the promised seed, God had him offer up his only son on Moriah. Regarding the promised land, Abraham never received it. In fact, he had to bow before the sons of Heth to obtain a small plot of land to bury his wife. How discouraging! If our experience were only that of Abraham—if God only called us and worked on us—our life would be too hard. Therefore, God not only gives us the experience of Abraham but also that of Isaac.
