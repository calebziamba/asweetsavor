_And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. — Acts 2:42_

_But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up against Paul with one accord and brought him to the judgment seat. — Acts 18:12_

The genuine one accord comes from the exaltation of Christ, through the filling of the Spirit, according to the apostles’ teaching, and is lived out in the local church life. Otherwise, a so-called one accord may present a danger.

It may be fashionable today to speak of being in one accord. However, history has warned us that those who tried to have one accord without having the spiritual substance to back it up produced not only serious problems, but severe persecutions, all in the name of preserving one accord. For example, the religious Jews rose up against Paul with one accord because of oneness according to their religion (Acts 18:12).
