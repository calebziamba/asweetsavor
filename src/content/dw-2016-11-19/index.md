_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

The root of our blessing is God’s calling, which He initiates by appearing to us. Without His appearing we have no way. If we live a religious Christian life, our serving is from ourselves. We initiate where to go and what to do. This is in the principle of the Tower of Babel. We must have the Lord’s appearing. Once we have the Lord’s appearing, we can go anywhere He leads. The Lord has first priority. Our mind will be broadened and our view enlarged when the living Lord appears to us.
