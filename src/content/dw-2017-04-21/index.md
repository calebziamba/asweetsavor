_Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord._ _– Genesis 13:18_

Today many of our problems are because we lack the life of the tent. We all consecrate ourselves to the Lord, but we don’t want to move once we have built this altar of consecration.

We must have a feeling, “Lord, You put me here, and I will be faithful to You while I am here. I am not afraid of hardship. If You want me to bear a responsibility, I will be strong to bear it. If You want me to drop what is in my hand, I will obey. I am willing to live a life of the tent and follow You.” This is what it means to walk in God.
