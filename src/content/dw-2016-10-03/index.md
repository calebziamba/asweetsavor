_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

If we love the Lord, we must let the mind of Christ be in us (Phil. 2:5). His mind was such that He let all things go, even His status as the One through whom all things were made (John 1:3). We can choose between two minds. One is that of Satan, which leads to endless grasping. The other is that of Christ, which leads to acceptance of God’s arrangement.
