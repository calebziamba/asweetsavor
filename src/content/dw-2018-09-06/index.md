_Just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts._ _—1 Thessalonians 2:4_

There are eight factors that fostered approvedness in Paul: (1) his sincerity and desperation; (2) his clarity of vision; (3) his pursuit of the truth; (4) his desire for fellowship; (5) his living unto the Lord alone; (6) his submission to God’s sovereignty; (7) his fruitfulness and effectiveness; and (8) his ability to teach.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 138.
