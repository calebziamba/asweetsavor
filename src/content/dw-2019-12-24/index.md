_“Behold, you are beautiful,  
my beloved,_ _truly delightful.  
Our couch is green.”  
– Song of Songs 1:16, ESV  
_

“Green” in this verse may also be translated “of grass.” The couch being green here emphasizes the growth in life, for green is the color of life. In verse 13 the Shulammite had an experience of consecration, saying, “My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh that lies at night between my breasts.” By this time, it seems that she had paid a price. When the Lord responded by praising her beauty, she realized that she had some initial attainment before the Lord. Now she is restful and full of life, so she declares, “Our couch is green.” She knows that the Lord is the One who is full of life and rejoices that there is so much supply, sweetness, and abundance of enjoyment in life between her and the Lord.
