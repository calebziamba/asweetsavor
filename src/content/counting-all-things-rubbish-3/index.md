> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8-9

What things are gains to you? Your career? A fortune? A name? Success in Christian service? As long as you have something other than Christ as your gain, you will not be able to know Christ in full. The secret of gaining Christ fully is letting go of everything else and counting all other things as rubbish, garbage, something fit only for dogs.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians)_ by Titus Chu, pages 185-186
