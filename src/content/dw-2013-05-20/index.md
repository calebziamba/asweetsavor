You need to cultivate your personality. If your personality has problems, everything you do will be wrong. A person with an improper personality cannot accomplish anything. A person with an improper personality is useless, regardless of how smart or capable he is, how high a revelation he has received, or how rich he is spiritually. His unhealthy personality will destroy all of his own labor.
