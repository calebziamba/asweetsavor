_But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, I went out after it and struck it, and delivered the lamb from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught it by its beard, and struck and killed it. Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.” — First Samuel 17:34-36_

Many resist giving themselves to be trained. If we are not trained, however, even though we may be very gifted, we will not accomplish for God what we might have. I am always impressed with people who have musical talent. Some can play piano by ear without any formal training. They can play beautiful music, yet without training their ability to develop any further is limited. If they wish to discover their real potential, they need to be trained.
