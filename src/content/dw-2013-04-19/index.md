_Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?_ _– First Corinthians 1:13_

Religious people want to be of a certain person, but we are not called to follow a man. We follow Christ. Some may not say that they are of a certain man but boast of being from a certain church. People think that if they follow a certain man, or come from a certain church, they will be “big shots.” Paul warned us to be careful, saying, “You belong to Christ” (3:23). Besides Christ we should be of no one and for no one. We belong to Jesus alone!
