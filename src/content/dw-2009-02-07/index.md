_Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my maids. — Ruth 2:8_

_I can do all things through Him who empowers me. — Philippians 4:\`13_ The name Boaz means “in him is strength.” Furthermore, Boaz is a man of great wealth. Both his name and his wealth indicate that Boaz, as a type of Christ, is rich and strong to those who know Him as their Lord. He is the all-sufficient One. His riches are unsearchable, and He is able to meet all our need, as long as we attach ourselves to Him. God becomes the strength to all those who are focused upon Christ.

Does this mean that those who trust in Christ will be kept from difficulty or will suffer less than others? No, it does not mean that. Those who know Christ as their Boaz, however, experience being upheld and carried through every kind of difficult situation. It would seem that those who experience such hardships should surrender and give up, but they cannot, for within them is a hidden strength that carries them onward toward God's goal.
