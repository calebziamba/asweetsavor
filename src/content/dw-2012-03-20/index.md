_And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. May you be strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son. — Colossians 1:9-13_

Many professors are frustrated with their students when they do not seem interested in laying hold of what the professors have acquired. Consider how much more important it is to lay hold of God’s economy. Therefore the apostle is very burdened for us. We, who are common people, are able to understand and enjoy God’s economy. We are able to enter into the full knowledge of God’s will. God has allotted to us a portion of Christ to enjoy! Not only so, but we also can now defeat Satan as we stand in our new position in the kingdom of the Son of God’s love.

I hope many, from the very beginning of their Christian experience, will realize that they as believers in Christ can enter into these four things. As believers we can know God’s will, possess Christ with all the saints, conquer Satan, and enjoy being one with the Son of God’s love. This should be our life. Fifty years ago I began enjoying these matters as one placed in Christ, and today I am continuing to know, possess, conquer, and enjoy.
