During the 2018 Labor Day Conference, brother Titus Chu ministered concerning the marvelous work of God in creating man, in redeeming and saving man, in creating the new man, and in testifying of Himself today through the body of Christ. During the fifth meeting, which was entitled, ["The Marvelous Building Up of the Body,"](https://www.asweetsavor.org/the-marvelous-building-up-of-the-body/) he took time to speak about understanding the relationship between the church that is being built up and the ground it is built upon in the New Testament.

The title of the conference was, ["Oh! Marvelous! Marvelous!"](https://www.asweetsavor.org/2018-labor-day-conference-oh-marvelous-marvelous/) It was held in Cleveland, Ohio.
