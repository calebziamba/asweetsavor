_Slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful._ _– Romans 1:30-31_

The personality which can be used by the Lord is not naturally good or evil. A person may have an irritable nature, but the Lord in His mercy puts His divine nature into him. The divine nature constitutes in him a new personality.

The divine constitution is not a matter of natural good or evil; rather, it is related to the manifestation of one’s living. For example, if a brother does not respect his parents at all, it is impossible for him really to love the Lord or follow the Lord. It is not healthy for a servant of the Lord to focus on the work and neglect his family. The Lord cannot use a person who works to the extent that he disregards his family and doesn’t care about his parents, wife, or children.
