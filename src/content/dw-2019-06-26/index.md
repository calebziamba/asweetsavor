_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

If we have the experience of the Lord’s chambers,  
we will not need to shout or talk too much; we will  
give others the feeling that we are like a bride on her  
honeymoon. We will be joyful, buoyant, and full of  
life. If we are like this, it will bring others to the Lord  
and even cause them to extol the love of the Lord.
