_I recall your tears._  
_– 2 Timothy 1:4_

The situation in Ephesus must have been difficult. Though Timothy may have felt that such a commitment was beyond him, he did not give up. However, it did cause him to cry. This is why Paul said, “I recall your tears” (2 Tim. 1:4). Timothy’s tears showed his approvedness.
