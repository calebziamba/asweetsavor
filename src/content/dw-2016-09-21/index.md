_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion...._ _— Philippians 2:1_

_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._ _— Philippians 2:5–7

_In our church life, we should be the kind of person Jesus Christ is. If we are rich not only in truth but also in the experience of Christ’s humanity, if the affection and compassion Paul spoke of in Philippians 2:1 are expressed among us, then both our serving and our church life will be full of vitality.
