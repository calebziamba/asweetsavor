_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.” — Song of Songs 3:1_

In spite of her trying, the Lord has no response, because the bed is not the problem. Rather, her response to the Lord’s calling is the problem. Her spiritual life is not the problem; her disobedience is the problem.

The Lord has called, “O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the steep place, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice” (2:14). If the Lord calls you in this way, you have no choice; you must respond. If the Lord wants you to go on, you must go on. There is no room for analyzing or reasoning. What you need is to follow. Your disobedience will cause you to suffer. It is useless to try to increase your spiritual activities.
