_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the edge of his garments. — Psalm 133:1-2_

Suppose all of the saints were desirous to serve, whether by preaching the gospel and having home gatherings, or by cleaning the meeting hall and mowing the lawn. Then we would surely have “Aaron’s beard” among us. This would allow us to experience the flow of the divine anointing.

There would be no murmuring, complaining, withdrawing, or backsliding. All of the saints would exercise with the headship of Christ, the person of Christ, the maturity of Christ, and the priestly serving life of Christ. Then we would all declare, “Oh, how good and how pleasant it is!” We would enter into the rich enjoyment of oneness as described in this psalm.
