_"He said, "Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel;  
for you have striven with God and with men and have  
prevailed."... and he was limping on his thigh."  
\- Genesis 32:28, 31  
_

We cannot mature before God without this experience. Without the enlightening before the Lord and through our environment, we cannot know ourselves and thoroughly surrender to the Lord. Those who have encountered God at Peniel can now serve with others, impart life, know Godâ€™s authority, and manifest God on a higher plane.
