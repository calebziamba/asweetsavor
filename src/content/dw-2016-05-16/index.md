_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _— First Corinthians 3:6_

Paul realized that no one person was able to carry out all of God’s work. His appreciation of Apollos’s labor indicated that Paul was truly a spiritual man. He appreciated others and esteemed them better than himself in some respects, recognizing that they could do what he could not. To see the body is not a small thing.
