_“Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight. Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.” — Ruth 3:2-3_ In this experience, we wait for Christ’s time. We do not ask Him to fit ours; we simply watch Him. After He is finished eating and drinking, He will do as He wishes. Now what we do is according to His schedule, not ours. We watch now to see what pleases Him. We watch His move. We notice where He lies down. We cannot afford to lose sight of Him.

When Ruth saw where Boaz lay down, she stole in, uncovered his feet, and placed herself at his feet. This was as far as Naomi’s instructions could take her. She realized that at that point, it was in Boaz’s hands. At a certain point, after we have prepared and done what we should do, the Lord must take over. We are responsible to offer ourselves and focus upon Him. He is responsible to accomplish what He desires upon us.
