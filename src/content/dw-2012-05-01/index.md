_“Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.”_

_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.”

_

_— Song of Songs 2:17-3:1_

We always think that obeying the Lord requires us to pay a stiff price. We don’t realize that it is more costly if we refuse. The loss that comes from disobedience far exceeds the price we pay to obey.

For example, when Abraham disobeyed God’s call to leave his country and kindred, God took his father away. When Abraham listened to Sarah and disobeyed God by having a child through her handmaid, the result was Ishmael, someone who later persecuted Isaac, the child born according to promise.
