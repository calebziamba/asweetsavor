_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _â€” Philippians 2:2-4_

The mind that is good for the body life is a mind that is of one accord and is humble, regarding others as being more important. If we have such a mind, we will regard not only our own qualities, but the qualities of others also (Phil. 2:4, Darby). This kind of mind is necessary for the body life God desires.
