The first key item regarding the content of Romans is that it was written according to God’s will. It is very likely that Romans was not the first epistle Paul wrote. However, under God’s sovereignty, it is the first epistle in the divinely arranged order of the New Testament.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, pages 3-4.
