_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Those in fear and trembling are very much before the Lord and seek fellowship from others. They are not lifted up in their own eyes, but are very low. They are fearful of acting independently and learn to depend upon other members of the body of Christ. If we could see how great this salvation is and how easily we could neglect it, we would certainly experience a healthy fear.
