_For You are my rock and my fortress; For Your name's sake You will lead me and guide me. — Psalm 31:3_

In David’s experience the ups and downs of the Christian life can be clearly observed. When he arrived at the cave of Adullam, that was clearly a down experience. When he recaptured the city of Keilah, that was an up experience. He felt Keilah might be his base, but then Saul appeared, and he was told the people of the town would betray him. That was definitely a down experience. David’s experience of growth was in this way, and our experience of growth is in this way too.
