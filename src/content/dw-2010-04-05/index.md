In addition to being equipped in the mind, emotion, and will, we must be equipped spiritually if we desire to be adequately equipped for ministry.

If you are a Christian who desires to follow the Lord all your days, the thing that will matter most is your spiritual development, not how much you can do or how manifested you are.
