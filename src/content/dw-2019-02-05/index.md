_For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare._  
_– Philippians 2:20_

Here Paul says that Timothy was of “kindred spirit” with him. This was the second factor for Timothy’s approvedness. The Greek word for “kindred spirit” here is _isópsuchos_ (Strong, no. 2473), a compound of two Greek words (_ísos_ and _psuché_) literally meaning “like soul.” Whatever occupied Paul’s soul also occupied Timothy’s soul. The burden of one became the burden of the other. Since Timothy was like-souled with him, Paul was confident that Timothy would genuinely be concerned for the welfare of the Philippians.
