Romans 11:33 says, "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!" (NKJV).

In this excerpt from the first message of the 2017 Memorial Day Conference, held in Cleveland, Ohio, brother Titus ministers concerning the first phrase of this verse: "The depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God."

The opening song is "By the Brook," a song written by brother Titus and recorded here by The Vios Project. Find more of their material on iTunes!
