_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith._ _– Philippians 3:8-9_

What characterizes the book of Philippians is its purity. The church in Philippi was raised up in a pure way, and the believers were very pure and simple. They just loved the Lord.

Why are we so complicated? The Lord said that to follow Him we must be like little children (Matt. 18:3; 19:14). We should not have so many considerations: if I do this, who will be offended? If I do that, who will be pleased?” Instead we should say, “Lord, I love You and desire only to live unto You. Lord, I am for You forever.” This is to be pure.
