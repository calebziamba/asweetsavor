> His banner over me is love
> 
> \- Song of Songs 2:4

Through the work of the Lord \[the seeker\] has grown to the point that she has the assurance to say, “Lord, Your banner over me is love. My sufferings, my being able to live for others, my enduring attacks from others, they are all because of Your love. You bring me through every environment so that I can live before You absolutely. This is Your love.”
