_Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And Saul said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” — First Samuel 28:11_

Samuel told Saul he could do nothing for him, saying, “The Lord has departed from you and has become your enemy....The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David” (1 Sam. 28:16–17). Samuel had loved and even mourned over Saul, but since he was unable to help Saul while he was alive, Samuel certainly could do nothing more for Saul now that he was dead.
