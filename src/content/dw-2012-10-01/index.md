_Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle Which feed among the lilies. — Song of Songs 4:5_

Finally, in His praise of the seeker, the Lord says in verse 5,  “Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies.”  This is the seventh and last item of the Lord’s praise. Originally she said, “My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh that lies at night between my breasts” (1:13). Now the Lord says, “Your breasts are like two fawns.”

Fawns are shy and timid. They are easily frightened, and they are sensitive in their feelings. Here, she is full of the sense of life. She also carefully preserves her holy sentiments toward the Lord, cherishing them up in her heart.
