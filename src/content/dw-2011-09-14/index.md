_“Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.” Moreover David said, “The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and the Lord be with you!” — First Samuel 17:36-37_

David testified to Saul that the Lord had delivered him from the paw of the bear and the lion, and that the Lord would deliver him out of the hand of the Philistine giant (1 Sam. 17:36–37). In the past, David had seen how the Lord had been his protection and realized that the Lord was still his protection. David was confident that the Lord would be with him in this fight.
