Due to our preferences we are naturally selective, but we all must realize that fellowship should be inclusive. A life of fellowship enables us to realize how great and grand the one body of Christ is. Therefore, we must be careful as we contact other believers, for if we are selective, we will forfeit our approvedness.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 143.
