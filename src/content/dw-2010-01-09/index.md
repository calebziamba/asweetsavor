_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine. Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; Your name is like ointment poured forth; Therefore the virgins love you.” — Song of Songs 1:1-3_

A person who loves the Lord can never leave behind the five elements found in verses 2 and 3. First, such a person is always under the Lord’s attraction. Second, such a person always seeks to know the love of the Lord. Third, the Lord’s seeker seeks the Lord Himself as the processed One, as the anointing oil with a pleasant fragrance. Fourth, this person will always appreciate the Lord’s work, as revealed in the Lord’s name being an ointment poured forth. Fifth, the lover of the Lord will also always love the church and appreciate the saints. At this point, the church is manifested.

No matter where you are in your growth in life, you have to repeatedly experience these five items at deeper and deeper levels.
