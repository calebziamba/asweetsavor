_And the Lord said to Samuel, "Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being king over them.” — First Samuel 8:7_ God didn’t want to give them a king because He wanted them to rely upon Him. Even when God gave them a judge, He did not allow them to feel overly secure, for when people feel safe and secure, they tend to forget about Him.

Like the people of Israel, we often desire a “king” just as the godless people around us do. But God’s desire is that we would depend upon Him. When we have money in the bank, a roof over our heads, and food on the table, do we feel the need to cling to God? It is when we have problems we pray more.
