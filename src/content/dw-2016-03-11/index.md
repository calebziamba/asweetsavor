_Then the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”_ _– Genesis 6:3_

Although flesh is first mentioned in Genesis 2, by the time we come to the mixture in Genesis 6, man as flesh was fully exposed and condemned by God. Mixture produces problems. Only purity can build up the church (1 Cor. 3:9–15). We are useless to God if we are not pure. We may make mistakes or cause troubles, but if we are pure, the church will still be built up. However, those who have a hidden agenda frustrate the building work of God. Because they are a mixture, God cannot work through them to accomplish what He desires. Mixture manifests the flesh, and the Spirit of God is in constant opposition to the flesh (Gal. 5:17).
