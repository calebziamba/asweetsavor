_“Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3_

The oils here signify the Lord Himself as the One who has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 22.
