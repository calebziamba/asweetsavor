_“I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live, but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”_ _– Genesis 24:3-4_

We the called ones are the bride the Father desires for His Son (Eph. 5:22–32). The Father sent the Spirit to the Gentile world to find His Son a wife. It is not a coincidence that we are saved. The Spirit sought us, found us, and brought us back to be the bride of Christ.
