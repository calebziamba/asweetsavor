_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_ _– John 1:29_

If someone tries to tell us, “You’re a sinner,” we should say, “I don’t know what you mean. I don’t remember that.” They might say, “Didn’t you behave improperly this morning?” We can respond, “Oh, I forgot all about that!” “How could you forget about that?” “I don’t know. I don’t think about my sins and shortcomings. I’m with Christ, the Lamb of God. This One is so holy. When I experience Him, when I enjoy Him, He takes away all the things related to sin.”

We should all experience such an enjoyment of Christ as the Lamb of God.
