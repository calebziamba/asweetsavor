No one has a heart that is free from being wild or free of self. We all have a “wild heart”; our heart is for ourselves, and we all consider what will be of gain to ourselves.

Surely not all of the saints will serve full-time. There should be all kinds of people among us, for this is the Body of Christ. Yet, while you may not decide to serve full-time, you still need to equip your mind, for your ability to follow the Lord depends on this.

Your mind must match your emotions if you are to have a proper will. When the Lord touches you, your emotion will not be the problem. However, it is crucial that your mind match your emotion. Don’t waste your mind. Your mind does not have an unlimited capacity. If you waste your mind on what is not of the Lord, your mind will not be able to be suitably equipped. Instead, all kinds of ideas will enter into your mind and cause it to become wild.
