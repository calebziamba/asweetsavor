_When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness....But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life._ _â€“ Romans 6:20, 22_

Formerly we were slaves of sin, but after being born again we are set free from sin.
