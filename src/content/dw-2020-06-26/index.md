> And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
> 
> \- Matthew 16:18

This is a grand, glorious, universal, statement. Number one, it’s related to a man, a common man, Peter. Jesus said, “You are now no longer just Simon. You are the son of Jonah. No longer the son of John, of grace, now, you are the son of Jonah, you are the son of the Spirit. Now, not only are you the son of the Spirit, let me tell you, you are Peter. You are a piece of rock. This is a special rock. Not a common stone. It bears the same nature as the unique rock, who is Christ. It bears the same substance as the unique rock, that is Christ.
