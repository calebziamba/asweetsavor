As those who are born again, we have been set free from the world. The Bible tells us that the world is Satan’s kingdom. According to 1 John 5:19,

_We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one._

The Bible also tells us that Satan is “the ruler of this world” (John 16:11). Before being born again we were a part of Satan’s kingdom, the world, but by believing in the Lord Jesus, we have been set free from the world. Galatians 6:14 says,

_May it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world._
