_In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat...._ _The dove came to him toward evening, and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth._ _â€“ Genesis 8:4, 11_

Once the ark was built and the animals were in it, God shut Noah and his family in the ark, and it rained for forty days and forty nights, flooding the earth. Eventually, as the waters receded, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat (Gen. 8:4) which signify resurrection.
