_“Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.”_

_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.”

_

_— Song of Songs 2:17-3:1_

Although her service was full of the Lord’s presence before, this presence became her bed. She was so self-satisfied on her bed that it became a hindrance to her following the Lord. She thought that the Lord’s presence, His loveliness, and the spiritual experiences were enough until this stage. She didn’t know that the Lord is inexhaustible. Although she could continue her spiritual life as before, although outwardly her life was not different, the reality—the Lord Himself and His presence—was gone.

Therefore, she began to seek the Lord. But she still sought Him on her bed. She couldn’t find him. According to her concept, there must be something wrong with her spiritual life. However, her spiritual life was not the problem; she was the problem. The problem was her unwillingness to answer the Lord’s calling. She was unwilling to leave everything and follow the Lord.
