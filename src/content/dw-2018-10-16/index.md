Before we can bear the mark of approvedness, we must be tested as to whether or not we live unto Christ alone. We sing songs about how much we are for the Lord, but then some lose heart and fall away. This may be because they are for some ministry, work, or teaching rather than the Lord Himself, or they may be for a certain feeling they experience when the church comes together. If we are not living unto the Lord alone, one day we will find that things have changed, and we will be stumbled.
