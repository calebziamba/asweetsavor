_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

Paul related the salvation he spoke of in Philippians 2:12–13 to something very practical. He said, “Do all things without grumbling or disputing” (v. 14).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ by Titus Chu; page 121.
