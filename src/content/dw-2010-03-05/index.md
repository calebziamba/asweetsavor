I would like to say something to the sisters. The young sisters love the Lord, but their love is primarily something of the emotion. I am afraid that after you marry, most of you will lose your heart for the Lord. Although you should treasure your marriage, your love for the Lord should not grow less because of it. Many sisters were absolute and consecrated before they got married, but afterwards something was lost, although they remain good sisters and still function in the church life.

Madame Guyon was married, yet she maintained a strong love for the Lord. Nothing hindered her from living for the Lord or maintaining her relationship with Him. She knew how to protect her heart.
