_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

The world began its development with three brothers who were the descendants of Cain (see Gen. 4:20–22). Jabal was the father of all who “dwell in tents and have livestock,” which relates to making a living. Jubal was the father of all who “play the lyre and pipe,” which relates to entertainment. Tubal-cain was “the forger of all implements of bronze and iron,” which relates to self-defense and conquest. Thus, mankind began a joint venture with Satan along these three lines that still enslave people today (Gal. 4:3; Eph. 2:2).
