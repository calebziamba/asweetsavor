_A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless the Lord, all servants of the Lord, Who serve by night in the house of the Lord! Lift up your hands to the sanctuary And bless the Lord! May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth. — Psalm 134:1-3_

Psalm 134 ends, “May Jehovah, who made heaven and earth, bless you from Zion” (v. 3). This is the conclusion of the Psalms of Ascent. At the beginning of these psalms Jehovah was the Creator. Now at the end of these psalms this very Creator blesses us out of Zion. He blesses us out of a glorious church life where He and His people are one.

May we all become such a blessing to the Lord, and may the Lord bless us from the glorious church life in maturity. Praise the Lord!
