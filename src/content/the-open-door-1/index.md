> _Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,_
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 2:12, KJV

Once the door’s opened, four things come. Number one: God is able to abide in you. Number two: the divine riches with the rich life can be united with you. Number three: this able Christ with His nature, with His vitality, and with His creativity can be mingled with you. Number four: eventually we can be incorporated with him, to bring out the accomplishment of God’s will.
