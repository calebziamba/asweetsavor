The first commission the Lord gave us is to love one another. Second, the Lord commissioned us to keep the oneness with our fellow believers. He prayed to the Father, in John 17:11 and 21,

_Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are....That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me._
