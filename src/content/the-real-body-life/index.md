This is the second message in a weekend conference shared by Titus Chu in January 1977. The first message, [_The Mystery of Christ: The Church_ can be found here.](https://www.asweetsavor.org/the-mystery-of-christ-the-church/)

We have seen that Christ is the mystery of God, and that the mystery of Christ is the Church, which is His body. We have been placed into this body as the many members. Once you have a vision of this body, your whole Christian life will be different.
