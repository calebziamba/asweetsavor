> For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ
> 
> \- Philippians 3:20

The Saviorâ€™s coming is the most important thing. Until He returns, whatever we can do is relatively limited. The older we get, the more we should sense our limitation and our need for the salvation that only comes with His return.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 250
