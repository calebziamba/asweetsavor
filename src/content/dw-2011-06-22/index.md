_But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall. — Ephesians 2:13-14_

_For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father. — Ephesians 2:18_ As those who are brought near in the blood of Christ, we can share the gospel of peace. In the church, our testimony should be that there are no problems among us. As we are enjoying the church life, we experience peace towards the brothers and sisters. Therefore, we should not produce reasons for disharmony.

For instance, we should not look for differences among us, nor place expectations upon others according to our concepts. Christ has produced peace among us. When we raise issues, this peace disappears.

When we allow Christ to rule in the church life, enjoy the freedom to pursue Him, and experience the peace He has produced among us, we are enabled to come to the Father together in one Spirit (Eph. 2:18).
