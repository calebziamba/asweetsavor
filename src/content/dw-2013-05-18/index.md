Brothers, you must love the Lord, you must be absolute, you must be equipped with the truth, and you must also have spiritual experience. However, it is your personality that determines whether or not these other things become a blessing to the church. If your personality has problems, no matter how much you love the Lord, how spiritual you are, or how rich you are in truth, the Lord simply cannot use you.
