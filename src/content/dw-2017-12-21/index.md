_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _— Philippians 2:14–15_

Although we are lights, we are not the source of the light. In a sense, we are nothing, yet we are the means Christ has chosen to shine out to those around us. We have been lit as lamps by the Lord, and He did not light us to be under a basket (Matt. 5:15).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 129.
