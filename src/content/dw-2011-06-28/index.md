_For it has been made clear to me concerning you, brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you. Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? â€” First Corinthians 1:11-13_ In the apostle Paul we see someone who not only taught oneness, but also practiced it. In the church in Corinth many were claiming to be of Paul, while some said they were of Apollos or of someone else. This is a very easy thing to do, even among us today.

Paul made it very clear that Christ cannot be divided (1 Cor. 1:12-13). This is a great truth. I have no right to stand as a Chinese, and you have no right to stand as an American. One should not proclaim that he is for this serving one or that serving one. One should not proclaim that he is for the young people, and another, that he is for senior citizens. Christ cannot be divided. All believers, by life and nature, are one. In addition to sharing the same life and nature, we should realize that no one has died for us except Christ, nor have we been baptized into any other name.
