_Now again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and it incited David against them to say, “Go, number Israel and Judah.” The king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Go about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people, that I may know the number of the people.”_ _– Second Samuel 24:1-2_

If someone receives Christ through us, or if the Lord blesses others through us, we should be joyful about it, but not for our own glory. Church growth should be for the Lord’s interest, not ours.

Too often we become proud after leading someone to Christ; it becomes a boast for us. When my companions and I first served the Lord while in high school, over one hundred were saved through our gospel preaching. I am still tempted to boast in that number, even though that occurred over fifty years ago! This is simply in our blood.
