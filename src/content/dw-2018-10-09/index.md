If we meet believers from a different background, are we able to fellowship with them, or do we disregard them, assuming they are somehow inferior? Is it not likely that they are for Christ? The principle of fellowship requires us to be inclusive rather than exclusive.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 143-144.
