> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> — Philippians 3:20 Darby

“If the Lord has called you to serve Him full time, you have no choice  
but to follow Him.” This is the ruling of the Lord in this commonwealth—we follow Christ, enjoy Christ, and never stray from Him.
