_"But I have against you, that you have left your first love." — Revelation 2:4_ One problem co-workers encounter is the love of work. Thus, when they become involved in the work, they can easily lose the reality of spiritual things.

This temptation of the work is one that confronts those who serve full-time. When the work gets into your heart and usurps the Lord’s place, your mind is no longer proper. Your delight, as the Bible says, should be in the word of the Lord, and in His law you should meditate day and night. Instead, many co-workers meditate day and night upon the work. Because of this they are unable to properly carry the work. Therefore, co-workers often feel frustrated, for their heart is focused upon the work, the issue of the work, and the manifestation related to the work. Therefore their heart is no longer right, and their relationship with the Lord is deficient. Instead of considering His word, or what is in His heart for others, their consideration is fixed upon how the work should be developed.
