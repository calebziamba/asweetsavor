> ...that I may gain Christ and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8b-9

It is good that being found in Christ is not determined by our ability. Instead, it is by our faith, and even that faith is a gift from God (Eph. 2:8).
