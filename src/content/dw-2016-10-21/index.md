_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._ _—Philippians 2:8_

Our Lord died on a cross like a common criminal. We cannot fathom why He went through all this for our sakes. Why would He suffer so on our behalf? Doesn’t this act drive us to love Him? This is the mind we must have in the church life.
