_“But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” — Joshua 24:15b_ A mature leader is one who has learned to serve by following the Lord’s lead and giving Him the first place. At this point in Joshua’s life, he had learned this lesson. He ruled Israel by giving the Lord the preeminence. His was a life of service to God, bringing His people into their God-given inheritance.
