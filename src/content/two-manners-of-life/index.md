In this brief study of Genesis 4 and 5, Titus Chu draws a number of lessons for our Christian life from the history of the men and events these two chapters describe.

This section of the Bible gives us the history of Adam and Eveâ€™s descendents from the birth of Cain until the time of Noah. It may not be so familiar to us as Genesis 1-3, but it is nonetheless quite crucial, for it shows us the origins and early development of the human race as it exists today. In so doing, it also gives us many valuable lessons regarding how we should relate to the world in which we live.
