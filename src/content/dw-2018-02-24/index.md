_“It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.”_ _– John 6:63_

If we only search the Bible for ethical teachings, we are looking for the wrong thing. Every word in the Bible is a word of life, because the purpose of the Bible is to give us Christ Himself for us to enjoy as the word of life. This enjoyment energizes us to follow Him.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 90.
