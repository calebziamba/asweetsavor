> let’s keep living by that same _standard_ to which we have attained.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:16 NASB

Some people insist on walking beyond their rule instead of simply enjoying Christ and walking according their measure. It is this “beyond” that becomes the problem. I am a grandfather, but that does not mean I have the right to treat everyone else’s grandchildren as mine. My boundary is the children and grandchildren of my own household. No matter how mature  
I am, I cannot freely approach the children of others. We all need to learn to function as members of the body within the measure of our maturity in Christ. The rule or standard to which we have attained should determine our service and regulate our living.
