_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

If we want to live the church life, if we really want to be profitable to the body of Christ, we must let this mind be in us. When we have this mind, we place God’s interests above everything else.
