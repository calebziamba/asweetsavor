_I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly.  
__– Philippians 2:19_

Timothy would not have felt he was being ordered to go to Philippi because he honored Paul as he would his father. Paul had confidence that he would not encounter resistance from Timothy, for they had a common view and heart.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")
