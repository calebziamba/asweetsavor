> Not that I have already obtained the prize , or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession of it , seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus .Â 
> 
> \- Philippians 3:12

We should never assume we have arrived but must continue to pursue Him our whole life. No matter how much we have gained of Christ, so much more remains!

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 210
