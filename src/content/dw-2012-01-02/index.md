_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 2:5_

_Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you. — Philippians 3:15_ Even in light of all of this, Paul still desired that the church would go on further. His desire was that the saints would become as full-grown as he was, having the same mind that was also in Christ Jesus (2:5). Having the apostle’s mind eventually becomes the substantiating of our oneness.

Oneness is not a matter of our emotions. It is a concrete matter. A young man may tell a young lady that he loves her, but it could simply be a declaration from his emotion. Our love for the Lord, however, must be something solid. Therefore the apostle tells the believers that he has counted all things to be loss, and has even suffered the loss of all things, on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ (3:7-8). From this word the saints should have been able to realize that anything else they loved and pursued would hurt them.
