_For there \[in Jerusalem\] thrones are set for judgment, Thrones of the house of David. — Psalm 122:5_

When I was young, I was really on fire for the Lord. I was never at ease. It seemed day and night I was struggling and fighting for the Lord. I was one of a group of brothers who were high school seniors in the church. Entrance exams to the universities were very difficult, and so one day I said something wild. I said, “I love the Lord so much! I have given so much to the Lord! Out of His righteousness, He must get me into a good university!”

These were like wild words from a beast's mouth. Just at the very moment I was making this declaration, an elder walked by and looked at me. I can never forget the way he looked at me. Just from that one look, I wondered, “What am I doing? What can I say? How should I repent?” I was scared. I was not scared of the brother; I was scared before the Lord. I said to the Lord, “Lord, is this really me? Am I that impure? When I give myself to You, do I have something hidden in my heart that You must pay me back? Do I really think that You must bless me because of my service to You?” There was such a judgment. When that judgment came, it brought my whole person into repentance.
