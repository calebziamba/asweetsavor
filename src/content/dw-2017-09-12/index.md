_Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies._ _– Romans 8:33_

Not many believers know their true condition. Though we identify with Paul when he claimed to be “the very least of all saints” (Eph. 3:8), when others point out our faults, we defend ourselves. This shows that we don’t really know ourselves.

Those who are blameless before God may not be filled in spirit every day or live a life full of glory, but they know their weaknesses and faults and cast themselves upon the God who justifies (Rom. 8:33).
