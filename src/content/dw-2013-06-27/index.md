_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _â€” Philippians 1:1_

We should not think that as bond-servants Paul and Timothy occupied a very low position, having lost everything. Rather, we should consider how enjoyable it is to be a slave. Actually, people willingly enslave themselves to things. We look for good leadership to provide stability and security in our lives. Very few of us are free. In the religious world, we can become slaves to institutions, principles, or people. In the material world, we can become enslaved to things such as our jobs. We can even come under the slavery of our own selves. Such things prevent us from being true slaves of Christ Jesus.
