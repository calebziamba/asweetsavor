_For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling place: “This is My resting place forever; Here I will dwell, for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread. I will also clothe her priests with salvation, And her saints shall shout aloud for joy. There I will make the horn of David grow; I will prepare a lamp for My Anointed. His enemies I will clothe with shame, But upon Himself His crown shall flourish._ _— Psalm 132:13-18_

We will conclude with verses thirteen and fourteen of this psalm:

_For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling place: “This is My resting place forever; Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.”_

This is the Lord’s desire, an eternal habitation. The psalmist in his maturity has brought something eternal into the Lord’s testimony. The Lord has His resting place “forever.” May we all exercise to bring in the substance and reality of the Lord’s testimony. May the church life become so healthy that only Christ Himself is seen. And may we all desire to grow until we reach this stage of maturity, so that we can exercise to bring the Lord into His rest forever.
