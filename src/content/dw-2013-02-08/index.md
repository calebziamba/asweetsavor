_“How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!_ _How much better is your love than wine,_ _And the fragrance of your oils Than all kinds of spices!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:10_

I do hope this word would stay with you for the rest of your life. You may work much, labor much, and serve much in the coming years. But in those coming years, will you still be able to tell the Lord, “Your love is better than wine”?
