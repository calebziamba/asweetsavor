_“Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:8_

_“You are a garden spring,_ _A well of living water,_ _And streams flowing from Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:15_

The Lord is saying to His seeker, “If you are willing to give yourself to Me and to allow Me to decrease you, polish you, and form you to My image, I will take you to Lebanon, to the top of Amana, and to the top of Senir and Hermon.”

At this time, we already have come to know the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice (2:14). Now our experience is that of an enlargement of the victory of the cross; no wonder the Lord’s heart is drawn to us!
