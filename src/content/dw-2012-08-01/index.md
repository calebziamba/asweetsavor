_So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day. — First Samuel 27:6_

Eventually David asked Achish to grant him a place to live outside the king’s city, and Achish gave him Ziklag. David was still technically a fugitive, but he was now acting as a king.

Do you think Achish would have given just anyone a city? He realized David’s men were a strong force, so he agreed to give David Ziklag. David had been cast out by religion, but those among the Gentiles respected him.
