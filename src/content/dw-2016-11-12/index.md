_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

What causes us to walk the way of the Lord? It is God’s initiation. At first we didn’t think about loving the Lord or following Him. One day, seemingly for no particular reason, God came and touched us. Suddenly we realized that the Lord is so wonderful! We began to follow Him. This doesn’t mean that we picked up a lot of outward Christian practices but that we found the Lord to be so lovely. Perhaps we cannot describe what we have seen, but we truly know that the Lord is lovely, precious, and wonderful.
