_Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make your call and election sure, for if you do these things you will never stumble. — Second Peter 1:10_ God has chosen us, but reaching the goal He has prepared for us still needs our participation. To be chosen is one thing, but to fulfill the purpose for our selection is another.

Therefore, as those chosen by God we should not allow God’s selection of us to be in vain (Phil. 2:12–13, 16; 2 Pet. 1:10). As those who have been selected by God we should pray, “Lord, I am here to participate in whatever You have prepared for me. It is my desire to be faithful to Your selection.”
