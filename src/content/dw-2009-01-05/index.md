_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's._

_— The Song of Songs 1:1_

The experience of a normal Christian before the Lord is a "song of songs." There are countless songs in the world, and everyone is pursuing one of these songs and composing one of these songs. However, our Lord leads us to the most valuable song. It is a song of experiencing God. Some people are pursuing money on the earth, so money becomes the song of their lives. Some are pursuing power, and thus power becomes their song. We Christians need to enjoy the song that is above every other song, the song of songs.

The experience of the Shulammite woman in chapter 1 is the Song of Songs. Her experience in chapter 8 is still the Song of Songs. No matter where we are, no matter how many years we have before the Lord, no matter how young or how mature we are spiritually, as long as we are a normal Christian we should have the Lord as our Song of Songs. To live a life as a lover of the Lord is to pursue the song that is above all songs.
