_“Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? Where do you make it lie down at noon?” —Song of Songs 1:7_

If you truly love the Lord, it will not matter what your assigned work is. When the brothers have their own feelings and opinions about what you should be doing, and you also have yours, it will leave you feeling confused as to how to function, and you will appear to have a problem with authority. The real issue, however, is not what you should be doing, but whether you have the Lord as your supply and rest.

Therefore there will be an inner cry to the Lord, “You whom my soul loves, please tell me, where do You pasture Your flock? Where do You make it lie down at noon? My problem is not figuring out how I should be laboring, but how to gain the supply. The solution to my problem is not determining which vineyard I should be laboring in, but where I can find the full rest. Where is the supply and the rest? That is what I really need to find out.”
