_Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus...And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._

_—Philippians 2:5,8_

Paul described the mind of Christ as being humble (v. 8). No one likes to become lower than others. Everyone likes to be noticed and respected by others. For this reason, Paul stressed the matter of being humble.

His stress was not on Christ’s accomplishment of redemption; rather, he portrayed Christ’s humbling of Himself in accomplishing that redemption for us.
