Jesus said in John 6:63,

_It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life._

This means that the Bible itself is the word of life for us to enjoy.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 90.
