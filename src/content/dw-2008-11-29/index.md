_That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead. â€”Philippians 3:10-11_ We must ask ourselves, do we have a subjective Christ? We know so many facts about Him, but is He real to us? We can talk about Him and appreciate Him, but do we experience Him in our daily life? To be born again is to have a genuine, subjective experience of Christ. But that should only be the beginning. We need to substantiate our born again experience day after day and year after year. We should enjoy the riches we received from our salvation throughout our entire life. The Lord saved us so that He could be subjective to us. What we received the moment we first opened our heart and believed in the Lord Jesus should become our continuous enjoyment. This is what the Lord desires, and this is why we were born again.
