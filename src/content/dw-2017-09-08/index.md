_But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the bondwoman and her son, For the son of the bondwoman shall not be an heir with the son of the free woman.”_ _– Galatians 4:30_

Abraham got rid of the flesh by being circumcised and, once Isaac was born and weaned, by casting out Ishmael. The way to gain God is simple—live and walk in the Spirit (Gal. 5:25). If we do this, God will give us an environment to get rid of our flesh. He will give us the strength to “cast out the bondwoman \[Hagar\] and her son \[Ishmael\]” (4:30).
