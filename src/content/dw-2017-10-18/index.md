_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

Though Abraham was weak, he feared God to the uttermost. If we want to know how spiritual we are, we must check how much we fear God.
