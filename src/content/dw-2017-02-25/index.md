_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Most of the time we don’t realize we need salvation. In the things we can do well or easily, we simply do not seek it. This is why we often come short in working it out. We don’t realize that when we buy a shirt, we need to experience salvation. When we have our hair cut, we need to apply this salvation. As we carry out our daily chores, are we experiencing this salvation? Many times, we reject this salvation because we do not realize how much we need to lay hold of it.
