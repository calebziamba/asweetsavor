_When they did not find them, they began dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have upset the world have come here also; and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.”_ _– Acts 17:6-7_

When we are desperate and burdened, the things we do will bear a particular fragrance. Our preaching of the gospel will have impact, for others will respond to our approvedness.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 139.
