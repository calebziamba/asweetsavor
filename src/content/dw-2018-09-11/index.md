_When they did not find them, they began dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have upset the world have come here also; and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.”_ _– Acts 17:6-7_

The Jews in Thessalonica said that Paul and those with him “have upset the world” (17:6). Before Felix, the governor, Paul was charged with being “a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension” (24:5). Paul’s absoluteness was irrepressible. Of course, he was also very rich in truth, experience, and vision, but what primarily characterized Paul was his sincerity and burden.
