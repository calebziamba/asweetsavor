_That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit._ _– John 3:6_

When you worship God, who is Spirit, He is mingled with your spirit, and so you and God become one in spirit. Thus, real worship means to have a deep, personal, and intimate contact with God in spirit.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 73.
