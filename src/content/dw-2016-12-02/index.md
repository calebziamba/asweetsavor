_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’”_ _–  Acts 7:2-3_

Once we receive God’s calling, we need to rely on His power and unchanging nature. Without this, we are building a Tower of Babel. We are nothing but trouble. God initiated, appeared, called, and promised, but our following is not automatic. Our following can only be based on God’s power and unchanging nature.
