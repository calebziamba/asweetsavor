_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

The third key item regarding the content of Romans is that it is structured around salvation, life, and building. As basic as these seem, over our Christian life we can never get away from any of them. We should pay careful attention to these three things, because all of God’s work is based upon them.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 9.
