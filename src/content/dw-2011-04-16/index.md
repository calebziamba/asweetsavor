_Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him. — Ephesians 1:15-17_ The church is God’s eternal purpose. It is the goal of the Father’s predestination, the Son’s redemption, and the sealing of the Spirit (Eph. 1:1-14). The three are one God, of course, and should not be too strongly differentiated. For example, is not Jesus also the Spirit who dwells within you? The Bible, however, does make a distinction as to how the Father, the Son, and the Spirit function for the fulfillment of God’s purpose. The Father predestinated us to be His church before the creation of the world, and in time the Son came to redeem us. Eventually we received the Spirit, who applies all that the Triune God is to us.

Seeing this, the apostle desired that we would substantiate this divine reality in our experience, so he prayed that God would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him (Eph. 1:17).
