## Chapter 1: Freshness after Failure, Famine, and Death

This chapter is a general introduction to the book of Ruth, calling it one of the most extremely pure books in the Bible. This is especially true when compared with the many stories before it, from Judges all the way back to Genesis. We should appreciate this purity.

This chapter also sets up the story. Elimilech and Naomi were a good couple who produced lack-luster second-generation sons. However, rather than trusting in the Lord when there was a famine and when leadership was lacking, the family moved to Moab. In a new life far from the Lord, Elimilech soon died, just like we will spiritually when we marry the world. Yet God used this, along with the death of the two sons, to set up a new beginning for Naomi and Ruth.

## Chapter 2: The Path to a Real Christ

The book of Ruth opens with a family in a good situation, then leaving for the world, then with the widowed wife returning to Israel again. Eventually, something for God is produced in the book of Ruth, yet these stages are all needed to get that production. These stages also mirror our experience in the church. The first stage represents an enjoyable and rich church life, when we love the saints and richly experience the Lord. All who are caught by the Lord, however, will eventually come to the second stage. This stage is marked by famine in the church life, whether real or imagined. We may question the things done by leadership. We are tested. In this testing, the Lord only has to touch us a little for us to find how weak and full of failure we are. He may even take away what we so strongly leaned on before, as he took away Naomi’s husband and two sons. Yet out of such trials, we become spiritual--we realize that only the Lord is worthwhile, and we begin to hunger more for Christ Himself.

## Chapter 3: Returning to the Riches in God’s House

In this chapter, the character of Naomi is really highlighted. First, she was passing through the three stages mentioned in the last chapter. Second, her desire to return to Israel was not for food or riches, but for the Lord Himself. Third, she revealed a high humanity in genuinely caring for her two daughters-in-law. Finally, she revealed no self-confidence when returning, yet recognized God as the All-Sufficient One. Her hard process had truly caused her to grow spiritually. Ruth is also mentioned--a picture of a young believer determining to stick with a more mature believer. Her declaration, “Your God will be my God” shows the importance of having someone to care for us in the church life.
