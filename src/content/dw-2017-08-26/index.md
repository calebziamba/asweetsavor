_It came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. – Genesis 15:17 (ASV)_

We shouldn’t overly appreciate the flaming torch or fear the smoking furnace. When things happen to us, no matter big or small, we should immediately know the torch or the furnace is coming. The furnace is for the torch and the torch is for the furnace. If we are always peaceful and seem to have the presence of the Lord, there must be some problem. Young Christians, especially, should have profound experiences from time to time. If we have experienced no hardship or adversity for an entire year, we should wonder why, since “those whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives” (Heb. 12:6).
