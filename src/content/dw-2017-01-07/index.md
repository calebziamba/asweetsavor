_You are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household._ _– Ephesians 2:19_

Ephesians 2:19 tells us that when we were born again, we were born into God’s household. The word “household” in this verse can also be translated as “family,” which means that we have become members of the family of God.
