_Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, so that he stuck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night. — First Samuel 19:10_ The first person David ran to was Samuel. The Lord had used Samuel to anoint David, but David had to learn that if he relied upon Samuel, he would be in trouble when Samuel was gone. Next, he went to his closest companion, Saul’s son Jonathan. Jonathan loved him but could not become David’s refuge in time of trouble. David then visited the priests of Nob, but both he and they realized he could not stay there. They gave him bread for his journey—an act they later paid for dearly—but they could not shelter him. David then fled for refuge outside the land of Israel to King Achish of the Philistines. Here he was compelled to act insane because they found out who he was.
