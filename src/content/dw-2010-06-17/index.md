In order to have one accord, you must remain simple. If you are always considering whether or not you are in one accord, then you could never be in one accord. You have made it too complicated. What does exultation mean? It is when a person is happy. A happy person is a simple person. Someone who is simple can just declare, “Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Amen! Oh Hallelujah!” If you are such a person, then when I am with you I can simply join in and become happy too.

But suppose I begin to ask questions like, “How many years have you been saved?” After you respond, I think, “Hmmm, I was saved before you were born.” Or I may ask, “How many trainings have you been in?” You say, “Almost all of them.” And I respond, “So why haven’t you grown so well?” Do you believe there will be one accord? On the contrary, we will end up fighting.

Yet if I do not care how many trainings you have been in, or how many times you have read the Bible, or how long you have been saved, what then? We have one essence, one element, one life, one nature, one existence, one living, one operation, one purpose, one substance, and one enlargement. Amen! Now we are restful. There are no issues. Nothing is complicated. We do not have unnecessary talking. We only have the church life where we love Jesus. In this church life we only declare His name and enjoy one another while dining together with exultation and simplicity of heart.
