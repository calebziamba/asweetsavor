_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

I have grown in Christ for over fifty years. This growth has come from laying hold of this salvation out of fear and trembling. I have nothing that I can boast in or lay claim to. It is all the Lord’s mercy. Anything I have or do apart from Christ and His body is nothing and accomplishes nothing in the working out of this salvation.
