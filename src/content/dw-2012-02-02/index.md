_"O my dove, In the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_

The Lord’s desire to see us in the clefts of the rock shows us that all the experiences of the Lord should be ours also. We should experience how He humbled himself, suffered, was despised, and was reproached. Therefore we need to experience being joined with the Lord in the clefts of the rock, which is to be in union with Christ at His cross.
