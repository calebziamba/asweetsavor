In Genesis 11 the people of the earth desired to exalt themselves and determined to build the city and tower of Babel, saying, “Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name” (Gen. 11:4). Satan had a similar desire when he rebelled. He wanted to exalt his name and make himself like the Most High (Isa. 14:13–14). Satan wasn’t trying to replace God or overthrow Him but to be equal to Him. This was the reason he was cast “as profane out of the mountain of God” (Ezek. 28:16).
