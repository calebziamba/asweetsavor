_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

Day by day, the Philippians walked with Christ and enjoyed Him as their offerings to God until they were constituted with Him and expressed Him in their living and labor. Once they had become such people, Paul, who had ministered Christ to them, could pour himself out further as an enriching drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of their faith.
