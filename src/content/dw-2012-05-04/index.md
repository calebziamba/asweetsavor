_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.” — Song of Songs 3:1_

In response, she seeks the Lord everywhere. Pitifully, she thinks her “bed” is insufficient. She doesn’t realize that her unwillingness to answer the Lord’s calling is the cause of the Lord’s absence. She seeks the Lord by trying to improve her spiritual exercise rather than by acknowledging her disobedience.

Perhaps where she once had the Lord’s presence at morning watch, she feels so dry now. Taking this as a result of her laziness, she tries to wake up earlier, but it is in vain. Then she feels, maybe her reading of the Bible is the problem, so she reads as much as possible. However, that doesn’t work either.
