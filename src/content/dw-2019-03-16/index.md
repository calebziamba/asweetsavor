_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

If a spiritual father’s conduct is hypocritical, his spiritual child will become a hypocrite. His unhealthy pattern will teach his child that it is okay to tell small lies to smooth over an uncomfortable situation. A father’s improper behavior, even in very minor things, can become very damaging to a young Christian’s growth. This is why spiritual fathers must guard themselves and be healthy patterns.
