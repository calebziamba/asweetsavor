__“Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like columns of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant? Behold, it is the traveling couch of Solomon; Sixty mighty men surround it, Of the mighty men of Israel.” — Song of Songs 3:6__

The Lord’s palanquin today consists of those who have experienced God’s inward working. Because of their constitution and stand, they are appreciated by the Lord and the saints. The saints appreciate the outward effect and manifestation of the Lord’s work upon them, while the Lord appreciates the inward working of His life which has borne so much fruit.
