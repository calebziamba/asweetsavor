_I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep._ _– John 10:11_

The Lord shepherds us outwardly by sovereignly arranging our lives, and He shepherds us inwardly by ministering Himself to us in the midst of our situations. We don’t have to fear or worry about His care for us, because Christ is the good Shepherd.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 79.
