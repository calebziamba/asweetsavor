Brothers, this is a serious matter. I have followed the Lord for many years. I donâ€™t want to talk about the older brothers. Of those my age, not many have survived in the church life, and even fewer are functioning properly. Those whom I have served, helped, and perfected, and who have all listened to the same messages, have often grown in different ways. Some grow very well, some grow awkwardly with their own awkward ideas, and some eventually turn quite negative.
