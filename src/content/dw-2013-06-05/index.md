Some are so insolent that there is no way to fellowship with them. They give you the feeling, “Those who obey me will live, and those who are against me will die.” If you agree with such a person, you are his good friend. If you disagree with him, he will be against you to the end. I have met such co-workers in my experience of serving the church.
