“Jesus, The Very Thought Of Thee”  
_Songs and Hymns of Life_ \# 111

This is one of the oldest hymns in _Songs and Hymns of Life_, and it is also one of the most tender. It is excellent for singing early in the morning to draw out our love for the Lord. The sentiment is genuine and delicate. A full love for Jesus hangs on every line. And it speaks from a heart familiar with the intimacy and awe of being in the Lord’s presence. 

Commonly attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux, the hymn apparently bears resemblance “to some of Bernard’s prose works, especially his commentary on the Song of Songs” (1). This likely accounts for the passionate, single-hearted love described in this hymn. The original, written in Latin from around the 12 century, is actually some 42 verses long! The whole poem has been loved for centuries and many different hymns have been put together from various portions of the long poem. Hymn #106 is actually from the same poem, though from a different portion and translation. 

The full version of Edward Caswall’s timeless translation can be found [here in figure 3a](https://www.hymnologyarchive.com/jesu-dulcis-memoria). Perhaps you will find some other verses you would love to sing to the same tune. If so, please share it with us in the comments below. 

Now a few notes on the hymn. Much of it expresses a straightforward love for Jesus, so after singing it, I will only comment on a few sections. [You can use this link to sing along](https://youtu.be/i-hsBIxsedw).

> **Verse 1**  
> Jesus, the very thought of Thee  
> With sweetness fills my breast;  
> But sweeter far Thy face to see,  
> And in Thy presence rest.

This hymn starts with the very fragrance of the morning watch—a thought of Jesus. We too often begin in the same place, when we find ourselves turning to the Lord, turned by a thought. Often His name, a Bible verse, or a memory of being in His presence awakens a sweet desire to find Him again. However, if not responded to, coaxed, or wooed, this fragrance is not enough to satisfy us. It will not linger throughout the day. 

I’m learning to pay attention to these subtle moments, even to drop whatever I’m doing to go and meet the Lord. He initiates these tender proddings, desiring to be face to face with us, which we can be when we turn by praying, calling, reading, and singing. This hymn began with our thoughts, and through singing we now can rest in Jesus in our spirits.

> **Verse 2**  
> Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,  
> Nor can the memory find  
> A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,  
> O Savior of mankind!

> **Verse 3**  
> O Hope of every contrite heart,  
> O Joy of all the meek,  
> To those who fall, how kind Thou art!  
> How good to those who seek!

> **Verse 4**  
> But what to those who find? Ah, this  
> Nor tongue nor pen can show;  
> The love of Jesus, what it is  
> None but His loved ones know.

‘Ah, this’—this is one of my favorite expressions in hymns. It means the author is trying to describe something too precious to be put into words. It is similar to the lines in #257 “O, The Bitter Shame And Sorrow” where Jesus is “Sweet and strong, and ah! So patient.” And that precious _something_ is what this verse is trying to describe. What is the love of Jesus to those who find it? It is hard for the tongue or pen to fully describe it, but His loved ones know it in reality. When I sing this verse, I like to exhale an extra deep sigh on the “Ah, this”, filling it with all that is in my heart unuttered of Jesus. 

> **Verse 5**  
> O Jesus! light of all below!  
> Thou fount of life and fire!  
> Surpassing all the joys we know,  
> And all we can desire.

> **Verse 6**  
> No other source have we but Thee,  
> Soul-thirst to satisfy.  
> Exhaustless spring! the waters free!  
> All other streams are dry.

> **Verse 7**  
> Jesus, our only Joy be Thou,  
> As Thou our Prize wilt be;  
> Jesus, be Thou our Glory now,  
> And through eternity.

This is the joy and the blessing for the heart who is enraptured with Jesus. For Him alone may our tender moments be reserved, and from Him alone may our spring of satisfaction flow. There, all other joys from family and life find their sweetest taste as He fills us with His glory now and through eternity. We may often feel that our joy in family, friends, even work conflicts with our full love for Jesus. But when He is our only source, He can surprise us by flowing His streams over these brooks as well. Pilgrim heart, set your heart apart for Jesus. May there only be room for Him. Then all the other dry streams can be overrun with water from His.
