This is the first message of the [2010 Spring Conference](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-2010-spring/) given by brother Titus Chu.

> _And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh._
> 
> _— Matthew 2:11_

> _My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge._
> 
> _—_ Colossians 2:2-3
