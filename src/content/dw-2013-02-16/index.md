_“Your lips, my bride, drip honey;_ _Honey and milk are under your tongue,_ _And the fragrance of your garments Is like the fragrance of Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:11_

In the Bible, garments speak of a person’s behavior. The fact that the seeker’s garments bear the fragrance of Lebanon indicate that her behavior is completely in resurrection. This shows that, although we live a normal life outwardly, we live a separated life and bear a heavenly fragrance.
