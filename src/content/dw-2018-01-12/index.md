We may think that the way to grow is simple—just read the Bible and pray every day. It depends. We need to ask ourselves: Is the Spirit revealing more of the Lord to me? Is the Spirit testifying of Christ to me that I may know Him in a fresh way? Am I being brought closer to the Lord? If the answers are positive, we are growing. If not, we are short of the work of the Spirit.
