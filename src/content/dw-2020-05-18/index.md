> But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
> 
> \- Luke 1:13

Zacharias is a godly serving priest. His name means “God remembers”. Elizabeth also had noble heritage, for she was of the line of Aaron. Her name means “God swears” or “God’s oath”. Together, they beget John, meaning “God gives grace”, who brings us completely out of the old age of law into the new age of grace. But in what way does this occur? Zacharias was serving God as a priest, even a priest able to enter into the Holy place in the temple. However, this is something according to custom. It is just the life that he was in. He has possibly done this many times before according to his habit, so he never expected anything different to happen. That is when the Angel appears to him to say “No! Don’t live by pattern! You need to live by the grace of God!”
