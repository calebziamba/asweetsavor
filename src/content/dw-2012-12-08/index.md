_“Let the young men now arise and compete.”_...

_So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side_....__

_But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men, so that three hundred and sixty men died._ _— 2 Samuel 2:14, 15-16, 31_

Abner could not accept David as God’s anointed king, and this was a source of much trouble. By making Ishbosheth king, Abner was able to maintain his military leadership. He simply went with what fit his self-interest, which led to the incident at the pool of Gibeon. Three hundred sixty lives were sacrificed to the self-life of their leader. When believers begin to fight, it is those under their care who suffer. We who are the Lord’s should never get involved in such ugly things.
