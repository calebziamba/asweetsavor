_Go forth, O daughters of Zion, And behold king Solomon with the crown Wherewith his mother crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart. — Song of Songs 3:11_

At this time, there is an espousal between the Shulammite and Solomon! Even though she is not yet fully matured, she engages herself to Solomon to be his bride. In this verse the writer does not say “daughters of Jerusalem,” but “daughters of Zion.” Zion is the highest point in Jerusalem, and it denotes the overcomers in the church life.

“Espousals” in this verse can be translated “engagement.” Before you are engaged, you can still date or choose someone else. However, once you are engaged, you must hold to your commitment. Someone’s love for a boyfriend or girlfriend cannot be depended upon. In a sense, before this engagement, we could have left the Lord for other things. But once we are espoused to Him, we can no longer waver.
