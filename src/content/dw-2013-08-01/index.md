_“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;_ _I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam._ _I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;_ _I have drunk my wine and my milk._ _Eat, friends;_ _Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:1_

By this time the seeking one has forfeited all right of authority over herself to the Lord. In chapter 1 she could separate her enjoyment from the Lord’s, saying, “While the king was at his table, my spikenard gave forth its fragrance.” Now, however, the experiences she has acquired of the Lord are not only for her enjoyment, but they also belong to the Lord for His enjoyment. She and He are now united as one. This is indeed a deep experience.
