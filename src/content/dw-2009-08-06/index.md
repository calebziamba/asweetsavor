Acquiring vision requires repeated experiences of revelation. This is totally a matter in our spirit. If our spirit is alive, strong, and anointed, we will experience revelation. The accumulation of such revelation produces vision. According to the vision we possess, we will receive yet higher revelations, and in turn, the higher the revelations we receive, the higher our vision will become.

Our life should be a life of receiving revelation and vision. The more revelation and vision we receive in spirit, the deeper and broader we ourselves become.
