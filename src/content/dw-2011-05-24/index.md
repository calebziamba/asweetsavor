The maturity that is described in the last stage of the Psalms of Ascent is different from the maturity we have seen in the previous stages. For example, the third stage, the stage of enjoyment, issued in a certain kind of maturity. However, that maturity was very individualistic. In the stage of enjoyment we became a blessing to the Body, and we were even appreciated by the other saints, but we may not have actually seen the Body. Instead, we felt that we ourselves were quite high and important.
