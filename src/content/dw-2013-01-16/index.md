_“You are altogether beautiful, my darling,_ _And there is no blemish in you._ _Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:7-8_

The Lord calls His seeker to come with Him not only from Lebanon, but also from the top of Amana. Amana’s peak symbolizes the reality of the truth. The Lord is telling her, “Do not just preach according to your own feeling as you did before. You have to see what is real according to the truth. The truth must not just be the words in your mouth; it must become your reality.”
