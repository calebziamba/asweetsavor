If as Christians we do not have a new living to match the new life we received when we were born again, then spiritually speaking we are just like a person lying in a hospital bed in a deep coma. No matter what you say or do, a person in a coma has no reaction. Is he still a human being? Of course. Does he have a human life? Yes. But, is he normal and healthy? No, because he has no feeling or sensation, and almost no expression. He has a human life, but not a normal human living.

In the same way, it is possible for us to be born again and have God’s divine life, yet not have the living that God intended for us to have when He gave us that life. Actually, when you talk with many Christians, it is clear that they are in a spiritual coma.
