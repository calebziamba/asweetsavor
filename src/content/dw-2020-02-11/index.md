_"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same  
things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you."  
\- Philippians 3:1  
_

If we do not have the joy of Christ in a particular matter, then regardless how good or spiritual it may be, something is wrong.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 178.
