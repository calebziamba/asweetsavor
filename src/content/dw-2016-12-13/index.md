_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1_

The portion of a called one is nothing but the Lord Himself. Without the Lord, all that we have and experience is in vain.

We should not think that the gift God has given us is our portion. The reality of all our God-given spiritual gifts is the Lord Himself. Without Him, there wouldn’t be any gifts. Eventually all the gifts will be done away, and only the Lord will remain (1 Cor. 13:8). The good land promised to Abraham is a picture of Christ as the portion of the called ones.
