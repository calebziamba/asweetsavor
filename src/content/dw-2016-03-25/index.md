_Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time._ _– Genesis 6:9_

Although Noah was blameless, he still needed the living word of God to carry out God’s will. Although God sees us as righteous and blameless in Christ, we also need the living word to serve God and do His will.

The living word energizes us to become different people. Those who have the living word of God don’t just talk about the need to be pure and faithful. When there is something impure within them, they feel the need to become pure. When there is something unfaithful within them, they have an inward demand to become faithful. The word is planted in them and controls them (James 1:21–22). This is the experience of having the living word. As we follow the Lord, we need His living word constantly.
