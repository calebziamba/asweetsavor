_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _â€” Romans 1:1-3_

The gospel is concerning the Son of God, who is Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, the content, experience, enjoyment, and constitution of the gospel are all Christ Himself. The gospel is for us to gain Christ and for Christ to be manifested from us.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 5.
