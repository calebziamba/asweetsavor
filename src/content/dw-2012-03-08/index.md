First and Second Corinthians are the first epistles that address specific issues within a church. These epistles reveal that the saints in Corinth did not know how to be with one another properly, nor did they know how to be with the apostles who served them. In Galatians, it was evident that the saints did not know how to be with the Lord, for they were rejecting Christ in favor of religious practices.
