_David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down to him. And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. — 1 Samuel 22:1-2_

If we want to raise up those the Lord has put with us, we must be a pattern for them in experiencing Christ in every situation and in investing ourselves in others. In all things, they should rely upon no one and nothing other than Christ Himself. This kind of healthy training is crucial if we want them to fight for the Lord in a way that brings in His kingdom.
