_I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy. — Philippians 1:3-4

Even as it is right for me to think this concerning you all because you have me in your heart, since both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all fellow partakers with me of grace. — Philippians 1:7_ The oneness illustrated in Paul’s letter to the believers in Philippi is simply marvelous! The apostle had the believers in his heart (1:3), and they had him in their hearts (1:7). Paul was also in the inward parts of Christ Jesus, where he experienced Christ’s longing after the saints (1:8). The saints also were full of feeling towards Paul as those who were in Christ Jesus (1:1).

Furthermore, this kind of experience was not merely experienced by all of them as individuals; it was something that took place between Christ, the apostles, and the saints as one entity! You cannot practice this kind of oneness as an individual. In yourself, you are not sufficient for this. This practice of the oneness requires Christ, the apostles, and the saints. If we are to experience this reality, all three—Christ, the apostles, and the saints—must be present and involved.
