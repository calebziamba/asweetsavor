_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

All church meetings are gospel meetings, because every church meeting concerns Jesus Christ our Lord. Bible studies, prayer meetings, and even Sunday morning meetings are all gospel meetings. In the church today, we can live a life of the gospel with the brothers and sisters around us, and together we can pursue the reality of the gospel—Christ Himself. For our whole life, we can live in, grow in, testify of, and manifest the gospel of God!
