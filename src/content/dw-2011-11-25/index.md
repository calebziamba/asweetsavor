_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

_Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14_

When the Lord does call to us in such a way, we respond, “Am I not fine now? Isn’t it nice here? Why are You asking me to go at this time? Are You sure?”

There is indeed a wall between us and the Lord. What is this wall? It is not the world, nor is it sin. Instead, it is the most beautiful, most precious, and most triumphant spiritual experiences. These transcendent and satisfying experiences become a wall separating us from the Lord.
