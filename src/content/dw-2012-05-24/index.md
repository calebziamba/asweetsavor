_“The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’ Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me.” — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

In chapter 1 the seeker was self-satisfied, but now she has learned to humble herself due to the experience of being in the covert of the precipice, and she begins to fellowship with the members of the body. In chapter one, she was enjoying the Lord so much in her own way that she didn’t know how to be with others. But here, because she has experienced being in the covert of the precipice, she has a deeper realization of being nothing, fallen, and corrupted. She also has more realization of the riches of Christ. She has seen the beauty of the members of the Body.

She is no longer self-centered, as she was in chapter 1, nor is she so caught up in the experience of the chambers. In chapter 1, it was the Lord who drew her, and she enjoyed loving Him. But now, she loves the Lord without His drawing, and He enjoys her love.
