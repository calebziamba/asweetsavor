_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. —Philippians 2:8–11_

Our name represents our person with all our attainments. For instance, the name “George Washington” includes all that he did for the founding of the United States of America.

When you say “Jesus,” God and man are both included. All that He accomplished—His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement—is included. In the name of Jesus is the fulfillment of everything on God’s heart. There is no other such name!
