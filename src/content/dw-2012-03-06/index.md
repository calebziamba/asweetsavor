The book of Acts records the raising up of the churches, and the epistles reveal how these churches should go on. The first epistle that follows Acts is Romans, and in Romans the basic plan of God’s full salvation is laid out. After this basic epistle we encounter some problems in the churches.

Remember that every local church is a “difficulty center,” and if those who are in the leadership do not know how to handle the problems, even more difficulties will be generated. Even when the responsible ones do know what they are doing, however, every church, in principle, is a mess. Therefore do not come to the church life with the thought that you will find something perfectly wonderful. Even though the situation may be messy, however, the saints are still your brothers and sisters, and you cannot abandon them, no matter how messy they may be.
