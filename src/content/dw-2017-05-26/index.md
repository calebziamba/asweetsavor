_When He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth, for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come._ _– John 16:13_

This verse tells us that the Spirit constantly unveils to us all the riches of Christ. The Spirit of truth will declare these things to us.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 71.
