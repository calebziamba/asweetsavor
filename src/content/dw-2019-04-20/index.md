_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

This book brings us to Christ as the center of God’s eternal purpose. All of God’s working is focused on Christ. God wants us to gain only Christ, to experience only Christ, and to enjoy only Christ. This is a book about “only Christ.” It shows us how Christ can become our subjective experience. That is the reason this book is so valuable.

May the Lord bless our study of this wonderful, heavenly, romantic book!
