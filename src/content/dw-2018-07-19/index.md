_For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness._ _– Romans 1:18_

Paul begins Romans with man’s rebellion (Rom. 1:18). We were rebellious, yet God desires to conform us to the image of His Son and eventually lead us into glory. For this reason, Paul describes both what people need and what they should experience, enjoy, and focus on. Although Paul had already written other epistles, the revelation of God’s complete salvation in Romans caused it to be placed before the rest of the New Testament epistles as a foundation for them. The richer our experience of this foundation, the more assurance we will have regarding the pathway of following the Lord.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 12.
