_"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord...."  
\- Philippians 3:1  
_

As Christians, we should rejoice in spite of our awareness of our own failure and the fallen situation around us. We rejoice because Christ is so real to us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 178.
