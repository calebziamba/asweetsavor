> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.

> \- Philippians 3:8-9

For the surpassing value of knowing Christ, Paul suffered the loss of all things (Phil. 3:8). He counted not only the things others admired but all things as rubbish so that he might gain Christ. “All things” here refers primarily to any and all things that might become our calling other than Christ Himself.
