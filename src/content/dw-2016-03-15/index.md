_Then the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. – Genesis 6:3-4_

It is never too late to come back to the Lord, but it may be too late to spend our best years for Him. Those years were already wasted on the world. We did not develop our spiritual function as we should have.

God’s judgment is serious: “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever.” When we have mixture, we become fleshly, and the Spirit of God will not strive with us. We need the Lord’s mercy so that we can love Him with a pure heart. Otherwise our heart will be drawn away to other things. We will bear mighty men and be judged by the Lord.
