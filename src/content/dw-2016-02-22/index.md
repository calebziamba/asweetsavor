Before we were born again we were children of wrath and sons of disobedience. Ephesians 2:1â€“3 says,

_You were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest._ Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ,](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 42-43.
