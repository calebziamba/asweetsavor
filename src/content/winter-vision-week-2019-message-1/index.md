In [this table of contents](/wp-content/uploads/2019.12.30-Winter-Vision-Week-Booklet.pdf), we see God’s Calling, but we also see our failures. You have to realize that our failures are not just single events, such as you getting mad at your wife and breaking a glass. But your failures really become part of you. When Abraham went down to Egypt, eventually, he picked up Hagar, out of whom came another failure, Ishmael.

Do you realize you are terrible? In God’s eyes, you are just terrible. But yet, God persists, ignoring the weakness of begetting Ishmael. When you have Ishmael, you have a problem. After Ishmael was born, God did not appear to Abraham for thirteen years. But yet, God is still faithful. He in His mercy appeared again to Abraham. For some reason, **God, He Himself, is Faithful to His Own Promise.** God says, “you are terrible, but it’s okay, I am faithful to My Own Promise.” Why? Because He is faithful to His own testimony. You should realize that God has a testimony and that He promised you something. What has He promised? A lot, lot, lot of Christ. God’s promise is that in your life of following Him, you will gain a bountiful amount of a heavenly Christ. A joyful Christ. An enlivening Christ. In this promise, you have to do some **Chasing Away.** Isn’t this hard to understand? Abraham should be so spiritual. Shouldn’t he know the difference between Isaac and Ishmael? But Sarah insisted on chasing away Ishmael. Finally, he became **Honored by both God and Man.** Abimelech comes to Abraham and says, “God is with you. Make a covenant with me, that you would not cut off my descendants.”
