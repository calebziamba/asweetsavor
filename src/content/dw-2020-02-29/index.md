_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

More than two hundred fifty years ago, a group of believers took this motto as their guide: In essentials—unity; in nonessentials—liberty; and in all things—love. This is why these believers, who came to be called Moravians, were able to prevail for so long. Regarding the nonessential things—things not a part of the common faith—we should allow others to follow the Lord.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 182.
