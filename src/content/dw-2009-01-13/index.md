_He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east. And behold, water was trickling from the south side. When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles. — Ezekiel 47:2-3_ The first time the Lord comes to measure the believer in this flow (for now it is a question of the individual, not of the church), the flow is up to the ankles. At this initial stage, the believer is in the flow, but the flow does not limit his movement. Such a person may declare that he is for Christ and the church, but in reality he lives his life as he sees fit. In name he may be for the Lord, but if there is a better job offer somewhere he will readily go, regardless of the Lord's need or the Lord's feelings about it. If he is in the flow only up to his ankles, he will make his decision with the job, rather than the Lord's testimony, in view, for the Lord has only been able to measure him up to that point.

As we follow the Lord in the divine stream, however, the Lord comes in to measure us a little more. His measurement examines and eventually exposes us. It is by His measuring that the Lord possesses us. If we are able to do whatever we like, it indicates that we have yet to be possessed much through the Lord's measuring. But when this Man of judgment comes to us and exposes our real situation, we are brought into the light and constrained to consecrate ourselves to Him. Out of such consecration, our experience of the flow of life increases.
