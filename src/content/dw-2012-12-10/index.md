_“Let the young men now arise and compete.”_...

_So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side_...._  
_

_But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men, so that three hundred and sixty men died._  
_— 2 Samuel 2:14, 15-16, 31_

If you do not know how to love the Lord Jesus as your Savior and how to appreciate the church He has placed you in, you will never grow properly. Instead, you may love the world and become a Christian worker who does not care about others, just as Abner only cared for his own position. I hope all who read this will only care for Christ!
