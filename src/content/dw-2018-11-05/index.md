Fruitfulness is valuable, but fruitfulness does not necessarily prove that a person is spiritual. A large work may be produced through natural means. However, we cannot say, “Hallelujah! I am spiritual because I never led even one person to Christ!” Nor can we claim to be spiritual if we have never shepherded anyone.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 148.
