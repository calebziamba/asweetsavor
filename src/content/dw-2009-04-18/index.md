_Therefore having been justified out of faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ._ _— Romans 5:1_

In our new position we have peace toward God. (Rom. 5:1). This means that we shouldn't be bothered by our personal condition anymore. We shouldn't say, “I'm so poor. I'm so defeated. I have so many failures.” According to the Bible we have peace toward God already. God doesn't remember those things, so why should we bother to remember them? If we look at our failures, God says, “I don't see them.” Then we also need to say, “I don't see them either.” Our Christian life should not be under condemnation, but rather should always be peaceful and restful. Now that we are born again we have peace toward God.
