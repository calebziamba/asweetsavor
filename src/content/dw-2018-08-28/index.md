God desires that we would be a testimony of Christ in the church life. If Christ is not in us, there will be no outward living and testimony of Christ from us. If Christ does not operate or work in us, it will be impossible for us to live out God’s eternal will. It is through Christ Jesus, who dwells in us, that we can prove the will of God and testify of God Himself in local churches.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 19.
