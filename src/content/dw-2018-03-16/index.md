_“I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.”_ _– John 15:5_

Although it is often neglected, one aspect of our need for a new living is our need to live as members of the body of Christ. However, if we realize that we are branches in the vine, it will very much help us to see the corporate aspect of our new birth, for the vine is a corporate matter.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 94-95.
