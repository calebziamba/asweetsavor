_“You are a garden spring,_ _A well of living water,_ _And streams flowing from Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:15_

We are joined to the Lord for His desire. We are just for Him. Although we may be carrying many things practically, in our hearts we just desire and treasure and hope in the Lord, the lovely and beautiful One.

What a wonderful experience! At this point the Lord can say of His seeker that she is “a fountain in gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.” She is indeed the source of supply to others. Others are growing in the garden, but she is a fountain in gardens. Others have wells, but hers is a well of living water.
