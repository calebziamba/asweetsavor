_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

The Greek word for “rejoice” here is _chaírô_ (Strong, no. 5463), which is the root word for _cháris_ (Strong, no. 5485), the Greek word for “grace.” This joy and rejoicing issues from the enjoyment of grace.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 136.
