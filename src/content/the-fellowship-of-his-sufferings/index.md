In the process of bringing a person to Christ, spontaneously we surrender our personal rights. Sometimes we may feel we have the right to relax at home after a long day at work instead of rushing off to care for a young believer. Yet if we desire to know the Lord, we must be willing to participate in His sufferings, for Christ forfeited His rights to save us. In order to raise up new believers, we must be willing to give up our rights.

From [_Philippians: That I May Gain Christ_](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/) by Titus Chu, p. 199
