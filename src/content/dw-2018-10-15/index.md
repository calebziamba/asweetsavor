A fifth factor for Paul’s approvedness was his living unto the Lord alone. Paul testified to the Philippians,

_“Whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ.”_ _– Philippians 3:7–8_

For Paul, only Christ had value, and only He was the unique goal worth pursuing.
