_“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2, KJV_

You don’t have to tell one who loves the Lord how often or how long he should pray, because he always feels it is good to say, “Oh, Lord, I love You.” When he goes to school, he will say, “Lord, I love You.” When he goes to work, he will say, “Lord, I love You. I desire that You would kiss me with the kisses of Your mouth. I long to see You face to face. We are bound together. Oh, Lord, I want to consecrate everything to You.”
