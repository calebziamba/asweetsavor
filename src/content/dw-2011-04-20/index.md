Young people are often told that they are the church’s hope. There is a Chinese proverb: “He who is yet a student should be esteemed more highly than he who has risen to power.” In other words, you cannot say how high a young person will rise. Who knows: A student may even become the president. Therefore, according to this saying, you should treat every young person with respect. But being young does not automatically make you the hope of the church. We all must grow in the Lord, for the hope of the church is Christ Himself.
