If you equip yourself with the determination to live such a spiritual life, you will find that the Lord is indeed in charge of everything for your sake. Therefore, learn to be spiritual in everything.

If you exercise yourself to be spiritual, you will equip yourself to be a man of the Spirit, and you will be able to serve the church spiritually. If from the beginning you do not equip yourself in such a manner, there is little possibility that you will be able to properly serve in the church.
