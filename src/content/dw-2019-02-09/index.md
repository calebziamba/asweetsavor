_\[Timothy\] was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium._  
_– Acts 16:1-2  
  
_It is not a small thing to have a good name in our local church. If we have a bad name in our own local church, whatever recommendation we receive from other places means little. It is of no use to be well-accepted by those who live many miles away from us but not by those in our own church.
