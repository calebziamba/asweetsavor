_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

If we do not have the mind that is willing to drop all for the sake of accomplishing God’s will, we will be like Satan, grasping at things that have not even been measured to us. We must have the mind of Christ if we want to satisfy God.
