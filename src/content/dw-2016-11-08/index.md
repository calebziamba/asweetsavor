_Now as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. And He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Immediately they left their nets and followed Him._ _– Matthew 4:18–20_

How did God gain Peter and Andrew? They were fishing when the Lord came to them (Matt. 4:18–20). The Lord took the initiative to appear to them. Jesus seemed to be nothing more than a Nazarene—could anything good come out of Nazareth (John 1:46)? He had no attracting form or comeliness (Isa. 53:2). Why would anyone follow Him? Yet when the Lord appeared to Peter and Andrew, they saw a glorious Lord and recognized His value. Then the Lord said to them, “Follow me.” This was His call.
