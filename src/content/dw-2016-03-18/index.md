_Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually._ _The Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart._ _– Genesis 6:5-6_

The deeper man falls, the more God is grieved. The love that God has for man is amazing. He is reluctant to punish him. God rarely punishes man. He doesn’t punish us simply because we do something He doesn’t like. Every time we depart from the face of God, He is grieved in His heart. Instead of letting us go, He disciplines us in His love. He will have another beginning and start His work again.
