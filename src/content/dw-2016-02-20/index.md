_I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification._ _– Romans 6:19_

Before we knew the Lord, we were just slaves to impurity and lawlessness. We had no way to free ourselves, even though we may have tried many times, and even made up our mind to change. There were things about ourselves that we knew were wrong, and we decided, “I’m not going to do those things anymore.” Nonetheless, there was a power within us that enslaved us to those unclean things, and we found that in ourselves we had no ability to change.

This shows us that, as the Bible says, we were slaves to impurity and lawlessness. This was part of our hopeless position before we were born again.
