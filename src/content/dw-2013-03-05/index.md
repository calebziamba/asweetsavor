_“Awake, O north wind,_ _And come, wind of the south;_ _Make my garden breathe out fragrance,_ _Let its spices be wafted abroad._ _May my beloved come into his garden_ _And eat its choice fruits!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:16_

How bold and buoyant the seeker is here! She is so joyful that she has become the blessing of the church and the enjoyment of the Lord, yet she asks for all kinds of environments. She doesn’t want to live a common life. She desires a life full of all kinds of new experiences. Although she doesn’t understand what she is asking for, her yearning still pleases the Lord.
