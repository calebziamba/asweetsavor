_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren._ _– Romans 8:29_

God arranges all the environments around us to conform us to the image of His Son, so that we might be led into glory (8:28–30). Romans 9–11 should give us an appreciation and assurance regarding God’s sovereignty. Romans 12–16 then describes a healthy local church life in which we can experience the renewing of our minds, transformation, and healthy spiritual growth.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 11.
