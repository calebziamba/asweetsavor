_“The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’ Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me.” — Song of Songs 3:3-4_ Thank the Lord for His mercy. After she suffered for a period of time, the Lord appeared to her again. At this time she held the Lord and would not let go. She was in the chambers again. It seems that she was back in chapter 1, afraid of losing the Lord’s presence. However, she now had some growth. She had gone on further with the Lord during her period of searching.
