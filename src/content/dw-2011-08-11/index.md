_“You shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them, until the Lord has given your brethren rest, as He gave you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving them.” — Joshua 1:14b-15b_ Joshua reminded the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh that when they asked Moses for the land to the east of the Jordan as their inheritance, he had them promise to fight alongside the rest of the tribes until all had acquired their inheritance (Josh. 1:12–15).

Joshua was simple. His attitude was that the twelve tribes fought as one army. As long as some had not yet laid claim to their inheritance, they would all fight for them. Isn’t that glorious? They all fought together for the Lord’s testimony.
