_Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power._

_For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those in Laodicea, even all who have not seen my face in the flesh.... — Colossians 1:28 - 2:1_

Giving messages and ministering for the Lord should be considered as two different things. The main emphasis behind giving a message is the message itself. Ministry, however, has as its goal the perfecting of those who hear.

Giving a message is fairly easy. Anyone can collect some facts and put them together according to a theme for an impressive and even touching message. A person burdened only about his message, though, is not truly interested in whether or not his hearers get any help. As far as he is concerned, his job is simply to speak what he has prepared.

To minister for the Lord is different. When someone ministers, he has a burden, he has a purpose, he has truth, he has content, he has revelations, and he has inspiration. But most importantly, he has the perfecting of the saints in view.
