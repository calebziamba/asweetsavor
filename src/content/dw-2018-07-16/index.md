_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. – Romans 5:10_

The fifth key item regarding the content of Romans is that it unveils our triune God’s complete work of salvation, a spiritual reality that is the base of all of Paul’s epistles. Paul shows us in Romans that God’s work in people is His complete salvation.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 12.
