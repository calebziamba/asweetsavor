_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _— Philippians 1:2_

Paul greeted the Philippians by saying, “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (v. 2). Paul loved these two words, grace and peace. He used them in almost every letter he wrote. What is grace? Many Christians define grace as unmerited favor or God’s material blessing. However, grace is more than favor and goes beyond outward blessings. Grace is a matter of a life relationship with a wonderful person. In that relationship, there is something so soothing, so tender, so satisfying, and so encouraging. When we enjoy Christ, we experience this grace, and this brings us peace. Grace and peace must be our daily experience. When Christ, who is full of grace, reaches us, He brings us into a realm of grace where we experience peace and satisfaction (John 1:14, 16–17).
