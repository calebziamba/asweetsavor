What kind of person is Christ, and what are the riches of Christ that we may enjoy? Actually, the riches of Christ cannot be exhausted. In the remainder of this chapter, however, we will consider six items of His riches that are revealed in the Gospel of John.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 74.
