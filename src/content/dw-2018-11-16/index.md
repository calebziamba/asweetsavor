_Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?_ _– 2 Corinthians 11:28-29_

If, as we shepherd others, we have a sense of weakness, a feeling of how we need the Lord to care for them Himself, we will become more burdened for those around us. We will become more desperate and spend ourselves more on others. This is what it means to serve the Lord. We will no longer live according to ourselves but according to Christ and according to the need of those we are caring for. What a glorious life! This is a life that is approved by God.
