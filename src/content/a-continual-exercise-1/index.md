> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ

> \- Philippians 3:8

This applies to churches as well as individuals. The day a church declares, “We have it; we see it; now we have the way!” is the day Christ’s presence disappears. So many Christian groups began with fresh revelation from the Lord out of the Scripture. The problem comes, however, as they hold onto this revelation instead of clinging to Christ Himself. They have a wonderful heritage but not much to show for it today. What frustrated their pursuit of Christ was not worldly things but the revelation the Lord had given them. Because they valued this more than Christ Himself, they departed from Him, and He had to pass them by (see Rev. 3:14–22). How serious this is!
