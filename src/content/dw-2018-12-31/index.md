We are held by God’s protecting hand. Jesus said,

_“I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.”_ _– John 10:28–29_

Even we, with all our mistakes, cannot snatch ourselves out of God’s hand.
