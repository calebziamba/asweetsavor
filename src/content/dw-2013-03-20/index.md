_“Now behold, with great pains I have prepared for the house of the Lord 100,000 talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for they are in great quantity; also timber and stone I have prepared, and you may add to them.” – First Chronicles 22:14_

David gathered material for the temple his son would build. He had already gathered much from the people he defeated in battle, and he dedicated this toward the building of God’s house. He collected timber and stones, brass and iron, one million talents of silver, and one hundred thousand talents of gold (1 Chron. 22:14). During all his warfare and afflictions, David managed to gather a tremendous store of materials. Perhaps others thought he was storing up these materials for himself when, in fact, they were for the Lord’s house.
