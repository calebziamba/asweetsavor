_Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you...? — First Corinthians 6:19_

Each of us has become a vessel unto honor, and our body has become a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19). Individually each of our bodies is a temple. Corporately we are also a temple of God: “Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1Ã‚Â Cor. 3:16). “For we are the temple of the living God, even as God said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœI will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people'” (2 Cor. 6:16).

In the Old Testament age, God's temple was a physical building in Jerusalem. But in the New Testament age, God's people are His temple. We as believers are now the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells and abides in us. All of us together, by being born again, have become the temple of God.
