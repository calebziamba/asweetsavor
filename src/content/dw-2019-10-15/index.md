_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

God’s work and speaking and the churches’ development came through the apostle Paul (Eph. 3:2; 1 Cor. 3:10). As Paul’s need was met, God was able to move and speak freely on the earth. Meeting the apostle’s need was not merely something material. Yes, ministry Epaphroditus provided was practical, but he carried out this practical ministry spiritually.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 172.
