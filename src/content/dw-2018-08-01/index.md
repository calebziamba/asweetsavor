_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Our reconciliation to God through the death of His Son is our judicial redemption. The verse continues, however, by saying, “much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” This verse not only mentions judicial redemption but also lifelong salvation “by His life.”

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 15.
