_And in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, â€” Colossians 2:11-13_ In order to live this life, we also need to be aware of the danger of being carried away by the things God has ordained in the past, such as the need for circumcision, which was troubling some in Colossae (2:11, 13). When religion creeps in, we lose Christ as our focus. We must hold to Christ and Christ alone, or religious practices will divide us.
