I am very happy when I hear that a young person has found a field. Young people should fight for this. If they begin to serve the high schoolers, they should not be there merely for fun. They should be able to say it is their commitment from the Lord and should be burdened for it. They should say, “Give me three years, and see what happens. I will raise up ten others to serve with me who share my commitment. Together, we will double the number of high schoolers who love the Lord.” This is what it means to have a field of labor.
