_O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; Nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me. — Psalm 131:1_

In Psalm 128, the last psalm from the stage of enjoyment, we were likened to a vine tree and an olive tree. But then, in Psalm 129, we went through some plowing. We experienced affliction in our environment. The Lord cut us deeply so that life could grow even more.

Soon afterward, in Psalm 130, we received light on our condition and saw who we really were. We realized that we were not so great or so wonderful. Instead we were filled with iniquity. After receiving the plowing from the Lord’s hand and the shining of the Lord’s light, we can give the testimony here in Psalm 131: “O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty.” In other words, we no longer think highly of ourselves.
