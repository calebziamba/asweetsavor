> Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

> \- 2 Corinthians 3:17

Nobody can control your spirit. Do you believe anyone can control your spirit? When you want to say “Oh Lord Jesus,” is there someone saying: “Don’t call on the name of the Lord, it's blasphemy”? Have you ever heard elders say things like this? Nobody can control your preaching the gospel. Look at Paul. Paul says, “Who can control me? In my retirement I want to write more letters. I want to have more of my ministry. When I am in court I want the gospel to be preached.”
