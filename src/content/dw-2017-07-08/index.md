_Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up._ _– John 2:19_

The temple the Lord is speaking of in this verse is not the physical temple in Jerusalem, but the temple of His body. What is the Lord building today? He is building the temple of His mystical body. Christ was resurrected with a physical body. Then in resurrection, the Lord as the Spirit was imparted into us. Now all of us are His body, the mystical body of Christ.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 80.
