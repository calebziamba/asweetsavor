_Because we are members of His body._ _– Ephesians 5:30_

_From whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love._ _– Ephesians 4:16_

The apostle Paul spoke of the Lord’s building work by saying that we are members of His body, and that this body is building itself up in love (Eph. 5:30, 4:16). From all this we see that we are now the building materials for the Lord to build us up together as His body. Thus, we should not have an individualistic Christian life. The more we enjoy the Lord, the more we will be built up as the body of Christ.
