> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
> 
> \- Romans 10:13

Calling is a simple matter. If you call somebody by name, he comes to you. The Lord lives right within us, yet for some reason He often seems far away. When we call, however, He comes to be with us wherever we are. Don’t be as the dumb worshipers of dumb idols. We should be those who are calling on our living God! When the living Person of the Lord is with you, all His riches are with you. He is rich to all who call upon Him.
