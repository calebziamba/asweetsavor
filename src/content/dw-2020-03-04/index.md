_"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."  
\- Galatians 5:25_

We must strive to follow the living Christ. As we are before the Lord, it is normal that He would lead us. It is better to make mistakes as we try to follow the Lord than to do things without Him. He is able to teach us even in our errors. This is the way to healthiness.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 183.
