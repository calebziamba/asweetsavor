_We are the temple of the living God; just as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.”_ _– Second Corinthians 6:16_

In the Old Testament age God’s temple was a physical building in Jerusalem, but in the New Testament age God’s people themselves are His temple. We as believers are now the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in us and abides in us. All of us together, by being born again, have become the temple of God.
