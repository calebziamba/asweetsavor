_“It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.”_ _– John 6:63_

We should not think that the Bible is just a book for us to study, for that is too objective. When we say that the Bible is the word of life, we mean that it is very subjective to us. It is a shame that so many Christians take the Bible merely as a book of ethics and teachings, and not as a book of life. They simply don’t know the riches of Christ that are in the word!

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 90.
