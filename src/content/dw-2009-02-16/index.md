_In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise. — Ephesians 1:13_

After being born again, there is a seal on us that testifies to whom we belong. We have been sealed with the Holy Spirit. It is no longer possible for us to belong to someone else. We cannot even belong to ourselves. The life within us will always remind us that we belong to the Lord. Second Timothy 2:19 tells us, “However the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are His.”

Before we were born again we may have thought that we belonged to ourselves. Actually, we belonged to Satan's kingdom. But when we were born again we were sealed with the Holy Spirit. We became the Lord's possession. If Satan were to come and try to take us away from the Lord, the Lord would say, “Don't touch him. He belongs to Me.” The moment we opened our heart and the Lord came into us, at that very moment we were sealed. The seal of the Holy Spirit testifies that we belong to God Himself.
