These messages were given the weekend of March 24 - 26, 2006 to a group of brothers at a retreat with brother Titus to help them realize what it means to serve the Lord by ministering His word.

In our speaking, we should not focus on being successful, i.e., giving a good message. Instead, to speak for the Lord in the church meetings we must first of all be very clear concerning our commitment from the Lord; He does not care for many things, but only for Christ and the church. We must also take care of such basic matters as being filled with the Spirit, being in the Lord's word, and being with the saints.
