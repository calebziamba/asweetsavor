_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's._

_— The Song of Songs 1:1_

_I have against you that you have left your first love — Revelation 2:4_

Whenever you lose the sweetness of your relationship with the Lord, you have fallen. If you lose your first love toward the Lord, you cannot tell others that you have the song of songs. Whenever your focus becomes your serving life or your need to be equipped in the truth, but not the Lord Himself, then you have lost your song of songs. Other things, even good and necessary things, have taken the place of the Lord. Only one who lives before the Lord can tell others that he has the song of songs.

What kind of life does the Lord want us to have? He desires that we have a life with the song of songs. Although in these eight chapters the Shulammite experiences failure and weakness, those experiences all occur under His sovereignty as a part of this song. The Lord desires that we would always be able to tell everyone, “I have a song of songs. My Lord is the best. My Lord is the fairest. He is all and in all. My serving is according to the Lord I love. My prayer and labor are according to the Lord I love. My life and breath are according to the Lord I love. Today everything that I have is according to the Lord I love.” Such a person is one who lives in the reality of the Song of Songs.
