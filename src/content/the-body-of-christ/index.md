_These messages were given during a weekend conference held in Columbus, OH by Titus Chu on the weekend of January 28-29, 2006._

We may know the term “the Body of Christ,” and even have the proper teaching concerning the Body, and yet be without the reality of the Body of Christ in our experience.

Therefore, in these messages brother Titus is burdened to point us to the reality, the expression, and the practicality of the Body of Christ in our church life.
