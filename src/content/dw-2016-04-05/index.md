_In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat._ _– Genesis 8:4_

The ark is not mentioned again in the Old Testament. It was lost. Though Noah’s experience of death and resurrection in the ark was precious to him, he didn’t seek to preserve it. He was truly spiritual. What he treasured most was God.

Unlike Noah, many people hold onto a spiritual experience. Given the chance, they would recreate it. They even measure others according to their own experience. It seems that only their experience is the work of God. How shallow this is! Noah wasn’t like this. We must learn not to hold onto our past experiences. God is always advancing. Our blessings from the past are for us to go forward.
