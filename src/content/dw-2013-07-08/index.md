_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

 _Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed. Therefore let us celebrate the feast.... — First Corinthians 5:7-8_

The word “holy” implies that we, as saints, are not to conform ourselves to the lusts of the world (1 Pet. 1:14–15). In the Old Testament, the children of Israel did this by leaving Egypt and holding a feast unto God (Exo. 5:1). Their feasts were holy convocations (Lev. 23:2). Like Israel, we today, as God’s holy people, are to hold a feast or celebration unto Him for His enjoyment (1 Cor. 5:8). We are the very celebration to God, and we are also the celebrating ones, the keepers of the feast, who are enjoying this holy celebration. We, the saved and redeemed ones, have a perfect position before God as a feast to Him.
