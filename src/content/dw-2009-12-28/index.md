_Ruth said to her, “All that you say I will do.” — Ruth 3:5_

We have to marvel at Ruth’s obedience to Naomi. If I were Ruth, I would have been filled with questioning and apprehension. “Clothes? Which clothes? And what if I go there and I cannot find Boaz? And if I do, what if he sees me and kicks me out? Or if I am able to find him and sleep there, what if he should wake up and get upset with me? I would feel that my life was over, having slept at the feet of a man all night. Naomi, your advice doesn’t make sense. Aren’t we living comfortably now?”

Isn’t this what many of us experienced when we consecrated ourselves absolutely to the Lord? Were we not satisfied as functioning members in the church life? So many are doing fine in the church life, but they refuse to follow Christ. The mature ones in the church life must be focused only upon Christ.

Ruth possessed something precious, for her reply to Naomi was, “All that you say, I will do.” Then she went to the threshing floor and found Boaz there, just as Naomi had said she would.
