> Sustain me with raisin cakes,  
> Refresh me with apples,  
> Because I am lovesick.
> 
> – Song of Songs 2:5

The capacity of any one individual to enjoy the Lord is limited. As long as we are joined to the saints and live in the church life, however, the capacity of the other brothers and sisters sustains us and thus becomes our capacity as well. Thus, she cries out to her companions, “Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples!”
