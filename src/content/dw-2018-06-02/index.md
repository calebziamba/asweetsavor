_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified._ _— Romans 8:29-30_

Together, judicial redemption and organic salvation comprise God’s complete salvation. Romans reveals that in eternity past God chose and predestined us, and in the course of time He called, redeemed, and justified us, so that we might be reconciled to God and receive the end of our salvation—our glorification (see Rom. 8:29–30).
