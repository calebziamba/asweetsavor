> \[The Lord Jesus Christ\] will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.
> 
> \- Philippians 3:21

Once we are regenerated, we enter the process of spiritual growth, which includes renewing, sanctification, transformation, and conformation. This growth process is our life-long experience and eventually culminates in our transfiguration at the Lordâ€™s return.
