_Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up._ _– John 2:19_

_Because we are members of His body._ _– Ephesians 5:30_

The more we labor on Christ, enjoy the person of Christ, and spend time in the presence of Christ, the more we will be one with all the other members of the body, because the building of the body of Christ takes place through our enjoyment of the Builder Himself.

We don’t have to make up our mind and struggle to be built up. As we enjoy the living person of Christ, the Builder of the body, we will automatically be built up with all the other members of His body.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 80-81.
