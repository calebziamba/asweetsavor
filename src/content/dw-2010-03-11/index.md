_And He said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'' — Matthew 22:37_ There is nothing wrong with having a business, but a business will occupy your mind, emotion, and will. This is why I encourage brothers to serve the Lord full-time. Our mind, emotion, and will are limited. We should invest our entire heart into the Lord’s recovery and with the brothers and sisters. We must equip ourselves with this kind of heart.
