_“Why have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.” – Second Samuel 12:9_

By condemning the rich man in the parable that Nathan told him, of the man who took the poor man’s lamb to meet his own need, David condemned his own actions. He had killed his own follower to take his wife, when he already had a house full of wives and concubines. By his own admission, David deserved to die for what he had done.

Why had he not felt this way before? As king, he unconsciously felt he was not bound by the same limitations others were. He thought he was above the law. This was David’s first failure as a leader of God's people—not restricting himself due to a feeling of status.
