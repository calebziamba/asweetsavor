Teaching is an art. It is very difficult to find a good teacher. Throughout my whole life, from grade one until I graduated from college, I only remember having two or three outstanding teachers. Many teachers have a lot to teach, but that does not mean that they are able to teach.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 150.
