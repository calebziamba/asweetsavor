_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

_Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel._ _– Philippians 1:27_

The Greek word for “encouragement” in this verse is _paraklesis_. This word includes the root _klesis_, which means “calling” (Kittel, p. 394). The thought is one of purposeful support, that is, we walk alongside others to strengthen them to conduct themselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ (Phil. 1:27).
