_“I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.’” — Song of Songs 5:2_

_Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions._ _— Colossians 1:24_

The Lord’s afflictions today are for the producing of the church. In order for the church to be built up, some saints need to fill up what is yet lacking of these afflictions. The Lord has accomplished His part. Now we have to fulfill our part for the building up of the church.
