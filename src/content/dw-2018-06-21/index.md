_Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are....That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me._ _– John 17:11, 21_

Christians often love their doctrines and practices more than they love their brothers and sisters. They would say, “I love the doctrines I believe, and you love the doctrines you believe. I love the practices I have, and you love the practices you have.” They don’t realize that our new life should cause us to be poured out, not upon these things, but upon our brothers and sisters.
