_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

The demand of sleep is powerful. It is not even possible for anyone to go without sleep for more than a few days. Yet the psalmist declares, “I love God’s dwelling place to the uttermost. I am just consumed by His house. Besides the Lord’s testimony I have nothing. My house is just God’s tabernacle, and His tabernacle is my house. But in my experience there is no bed here. His house is supposed to be a place of rest, but where is the reality? His tabernacle is here, but where is the substance of the tabernacle? Without the substance, how can I rest?”
