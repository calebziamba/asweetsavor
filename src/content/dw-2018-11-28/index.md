_But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know._ _– 1 John 2:20_

True teachers should always present a charge that results in a burden. I am not satisfied when, after speaking to a congregation, no charge is received and no burden is generated.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 152.
