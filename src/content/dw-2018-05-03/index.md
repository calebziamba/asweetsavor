_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God._ _— Romans 1:1_

God’s will is the gospel of God. This gospel, in all its breadth and depth, is the main theme of Romans. Paul’s description of the gospel in Romans includes Christ, the saints, the body of Christ, and the manifestation of this body in local churches.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 4.
