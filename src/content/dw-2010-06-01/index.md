_Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. — Exodus 19:5_

_But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. — First Peter 2:9_

From the moment we believe in Jesus, we begin to stand out to God; and the more we give ourselves to Him, the more our living and service will express the beauty of this treasure. The church today, as God’s corporate testimony upon the earth, is the significance of Israel becoming God’s special treasure.
