_He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering.”_ _– Genesis 22:2_

Abraham had come to the realization that he had to obey what God said. He had to follow God’s leading, whatever the consequences—God would bear all the responsibility. Abraham took Isaac to Moriah to offer him as a sacrifice. Can you imagine how Abraham felt when he took the knife and was ready to sacrifice his only son? At that time, both his eyes and thoughts must have been blurry. It seems a sword pierced his own heart. He might have asked, “God, is this the end of Your appearing to me? Is this the end of Your work on me? Is this the end of Your blessing on me?” However, he feared God and dared not refuse Him (v. 12). He knew he had to follow the Lord. It was needless to say anything more.
