_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

_Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14_

On the one hand, the Lord is standing behind our wall. On the other hand, He is looking through the windows and glancing through the lattice (2:9). In this state we can see Him and He can see us. He calls to us, grants us revelation, and allows us to see His face while encouraging us to rise up. We do not want to follow Him, however, for we are spiritually comfortable with what we have.
