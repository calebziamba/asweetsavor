_After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying: “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. — Joshua 1:1-2_ The children of Israel are finally at the point they are ready to fight for the land. This fight is of three categories represented by three cities. The first, Jericho, represents Satan and the principalities and powers of the air; the second, Ai, represents the world; and the third, Gibeon, represents fallen man. These three characterize the entire cosmos.

To bring His people into their promised inheritance, God had to take care of these three things: He had to destroy the power of the enemy; He had to deal with the world; and He had to take care of man. We will continually confront these three matters throughout our entire life.
