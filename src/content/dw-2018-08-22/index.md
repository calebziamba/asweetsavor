_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

Two brothers may say, “I am for Christ and the church!” However, though their words are the same, they may mean two very different things. One brother may mean that he has an old couch for the church to use. The other may mean that he is willing to live and die for the church and the saints; his words reveal that his existence, living, labor, possessions, and faithfulness are all for the saints. The difference between these two brothers is not a matter of right or wrong. It is simply two brothers in different stages of transformation.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, pages 17-18.
