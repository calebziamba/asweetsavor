_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

The genuine “encouragement in Christ” is carried out in Christ. We stand by one another in Christ. It is very different from much of the encouragement we usually offer one another.

If someone is discouraged, we may say, “Cheer up. Tomorrow will be better. Look unto Jesus!” However, the encouragement that Paul spoke of is in Christ, based on all that He is and all that He has accomplished.
