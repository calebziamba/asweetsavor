If we don’t have God and walk in Him, all is in vain. Our fallen religious concept is that we will be successful in all that we do if we love the Lord. Otherwise the Lord would be shamed. This concept is from Satan. If we truly know God, we will see that He is our only way. It doesn’t matter whether we are successful or not as long as we walk in God. If we walk in Him, we will praise Him regardless of our situation. Otherwise, our walk is in vain.
