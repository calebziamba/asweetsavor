_I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching. —2 Timothy 4:1-2_ Without revelation, we will feel that it is hard to go on in our reading of the Bible. I was told 40 years ago that Brother Lee had exhausted the riches of the Bible. But now, 40 years later, Brother Lee is still ministering. This is because he is constantly receiving fresh revelations.

The Bible has been opened up from the beginning to the end. Except for a few special verses, the brothers who have gone before us have opened up the whole book. But it doesn’t mean we should stop at this point. Brother Lee has told us that if the Lord gives him another ten years, he could publish another new Recovery Version.

Brother Lee is advancing all the time. As for us, our advancing depends on our growth in life. We should cultivate a healthy attitude, the ability to obtain revelation, and a proper person in order to continue the ministry of those who have gone before us so that the Lord’s revelation to us might keep on advancing and developing.
