_I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you. For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. Therefore I urge you, imitate me. â€” First Corinthians 4:14-16_ What should concern us is not whether a church has problems, but how those problems are handled. If a servant of the Lord knows how to handle the problems properly, abnormal situations can be turned to strength. If, however, the ones who are serving do not know how to handle situations properly, the problems can become the source of both institution and organization within the church. Any group that takes that line eventually develops into a denomination.
