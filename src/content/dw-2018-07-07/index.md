We used to be dead in sin. Now, as the members of the Body of Christ, we build up the body of Christ in different local churches through the functions revealed by our personal salvation.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, pages 10-11.
