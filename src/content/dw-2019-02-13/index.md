_\[Timothy\] was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium._  
_– Acts 16:1-2_

No mere church-goer can gain approvedness. Only those who know how to give themselves for the church life can be approved. As we live for the church life and serve according to our God-given portion, we will obtain approvedness before God and His people.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, page 156.
