_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

Their work defrauded others of Christ, which is extremely evil. Thus, they are not only unclean dogs but also evil workers.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, pages 180-181.
