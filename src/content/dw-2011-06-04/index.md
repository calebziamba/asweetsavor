_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_ We also should have such a fight. We should struggle for the reality and the substance of the Lord’s testimony. We all realize that the Lord’s testimony and His habitation are here with us, but we also know there is something lacking We know that we are far short of the substance of what we have seen. Instead of becoming defeated or discouraged we must rise up to fight. Instead of being indifferent we must begin to struggle to bring in the very substance which establishes the reality of the Lord’s testimony among us. This is a marvelous and glorious struggle.
