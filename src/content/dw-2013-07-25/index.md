_I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all._ _— Philippians 1:3–4_

When we think of other Christians, do we thank God for them? Usually when we pray for others, we do so with the hope of changing them. Instead of thanking God for them, we critique them in our prayers. The Lord might ask us, “What are you saying? Doesn’t this brother love Me? Isn’t that enough? What more do you want?” Many times when we pray, we are almost working with Satan, because Satan is the accuser of the brethren (Rev. 12:10), and we become accusers too.
