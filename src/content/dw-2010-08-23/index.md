_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

The Triune God will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver. “Plaits of gold” in the original language means something that resembles a crown. It is a ringlet, a crown with golden borders. This means you must let God work His disposition and nature into you. The result of God’s work in you becomes a little crown.
