_“You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse;_ _You have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes,_ _With one strand of your necklace.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:9_

May the Lord have mercy so that we may be the ones who ravish His heart. Although we know much and may have a strong desire, nothing is real until we ravish the heart of the Lord. We have to satisfy the Lord in everything and ravish His heart in every matter.

We have to take the real action. Whenever the Lord calls us, we should be able to answer, “Lord, I am here; I am right here.” On your neck is but one strand of necklace whenever the Lord asks something of you.
