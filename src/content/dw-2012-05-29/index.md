_“I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, That you will not arouse or awaken my love Until she pleases.” — Song of Songs 3:5_ By this point, the seeker has experienced the abundance of life, she has been delivered from herself and has begun to walk the way of the cross. Therefore, her experience is no longer on the plain in the banqueting house. She has advanced to another dimension, for she has experienced the power of resurrection.

This experience has led her further and made her leap. She manifests the condition of being good for the Lord’s building. Now she is really in the Lord’s heart. He loves her and has gained much in her. Thus the Lord says, “O daughters of Jerusalem, do not rouse up or awaken my love. She should rest, because she suffered so much. Then she can begin another stage of experience.”
