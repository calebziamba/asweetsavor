_You are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household._ _– Ephesians 2:19_

We have become members of the family of God. This shows us that we can no longer be by ourselves. We should not think, “I’ll just take care of my own spiritual condition,” for God wants us to be with all the other members of His family.
