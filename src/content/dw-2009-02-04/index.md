_And a river went forth from Eden to water the whole garden, and from there it divided and became four branches. The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. — Genesis 2:11-12_

It is significant that the growth produced by this flow is characterized by purity. Again, gold symbolizes God Himself, and the description of Havilah emphasizes the purity of this gold. When we first became believers and entered this free-flowing stream, our initial growth was characterized by purity. Those who experience the new birth are, at the beginning, very simple and trusting. They are not complicated. Such purity must be maintained....

This first product of the divine flow—purity—is marvelous. Only those who are pure will be able to testify that they have the reality of the flow. However, those who desire to remain pure should be prepared to endure hardship and misunderstanding, for some will eventually say that we must be for Christ plus something else. We love Watchman Nee and Witness Lee very much, and we recognize that we are their spiritual children. Nevertheless, we must always realize that the focus and center of our church life and our daily life is Christ, and Christ alone.
