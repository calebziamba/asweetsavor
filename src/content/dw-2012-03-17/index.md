_Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. â€” Colossians 2:18-19_

When you encounter other believers, do not talk about things other than Christ. Speak of your current enjoyment of Christ in the word. Fellowship about what you have experienced of Christ through your prayer. Do not seek out the things that differ. There is no need to ask what version of the Bible you each read, or discuss what kind of music your group uses. Realize that it is Christ who is the substance of your oneness. If a believer loves Christ, pray with him. Share your Christ. When we are in Christ, with Christ, enjoying Christ, and living out Christ, spontaneously we are one.
