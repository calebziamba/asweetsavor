_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

The Song of Songs depicts the work of the cross in a very striking way. However, the initial experience depicted in this book is not that of the cross but of our experience of Christ as a wonderful song. When we meet an unbeliever, we feel that the song within us is much sweeter and much more wonderful than their song, for the song within us is the song of songs.  
  
Such a feeling is normal for a Jesus lover. In contrast, if we don’t know we have a song within us, it indicates that our relationship with the Lord is not healthy.

by Titus Chu, page 16.
