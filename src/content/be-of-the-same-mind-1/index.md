> I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord. Indeed, true companion, I ask you also, help these women who have shared my struggle in _the cause of_ the gospel, together with Clement as well as the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.

It seems Paul was asking for the impossible. In the fifty years that I have served the Lord, I have never seen two people whose minds were the same. Even a husband and wife are different. Some people say that a man and woman should have a long courtship to see if they are compatible. From my observation, however, whether couples have a long or short courtship, once they marry, they always discover how different they are. Euodia and Syntyche may have been opposites—one sweet and the other like thunder. Paul implored them to live in harmony in the Lord. He didn’t say to do the same thing but to think the same thing.
