_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _â€” Philippians 1:1_

Paul and Timothy were bond-servants of Christ Jesus. This means they experienced being cared for by the One who rules all things. They were led by the Lord to live a daily life according to Jesus. The One who is over all became their Master. They experienced Christ ruling over them in His heavenly government. They had the living of Jesus under the lordship of Christ.
