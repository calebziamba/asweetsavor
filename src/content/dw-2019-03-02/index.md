_Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.  
__– 2 Timothy 2:22_

_The righteous is a guide to his neighbor,  
__But the way of the wicked leads them astray.  
__– Proverbs 12:26_

We must learn to be with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Our companionships reveal something about us. To be approved, we should be with those who are vessels to honor, who follow the Lord, seek only Christ, and genuinely care for the interest of the church. Those we choose to be with will influence us and determine our approvedness (Prov. 12:26).
