_Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” — John 2:19

Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. — Ephesians 2:20-22_ The fifth way we should enjoy Christ is as the Builder. “Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (John 2:19). What is the Lord building? He is building the temple. The temple that the Lord is speaking of in this verse is not the physical temple in Jerusalem, but the temple of His body. He said clearly, “If you destroy this temple, I will raise it up in three days.” Christ was resurrected with a physical body. Then in resurrection, the Lord as the Spirit was dispensed into us. Now all of us are His Body, the mystical Body of Christ. We are now the building materials for the Lord to build us up together. This means that we should not have an individualistic Christian life. The more we enjoy the Lord, the more we will be built up in the Body of Christ.
