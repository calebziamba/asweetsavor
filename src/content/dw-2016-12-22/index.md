_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you;_ _And I will make you a great nation,_ _And I will bless you,_ _And make your name great;_ _And so you shall be a blessing;_ _And I will bless those who bless you,_ _And the one who curses you I will curse._ _And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1-3_

Although God gave up those building the Tower of Babel, He gained a group of people through the calling of Abraham. Just as God’s covenant with Noah indicated that God would bear all the responsibility, God’s calling of Abraham was a further testimony of this.
