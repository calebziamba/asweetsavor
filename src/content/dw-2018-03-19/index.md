_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

Paul told the Philippians to “hold fast the word of life_._” They needed to hold fast to Christ as the living Word (John 1:1, 14) and not be distracted from Him, caught with grumblings and disputes. If they would turn to Christ in this way, He would be testified through them and the apostle Paul would rejoice in the day of Christ because he had not run nor toiled in vain (Phil. 2:16).
