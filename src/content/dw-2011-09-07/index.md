_And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul’s hand. And Saul cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice. — First Samuel 18:10-11_

_That the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ. — First Peter 1:7_

We often find it difficult to pass through times of testing because such testing seems unreasonable. We may find ourselves put aside and even blockaded by someone. Instead of having the opportunity to show what we are capable of doing, it seems we become stuck in a place where we are never appreciated. Yet we must pass through these times of testing before we can be approved (1 Thess. 2:4; 1 Pet. 1:7).
