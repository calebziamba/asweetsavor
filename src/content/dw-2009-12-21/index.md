Besides having the spirit of the ministry, you must also have the equipping of the ministry. Even when your spirit is rich and full of feeling, full of burden, and full of commitment from the Lord, you must still have adequate equipping if you desire to minister the riches you possess. Even if you have revelation upon revelation and vision upon vision, if you lack the proper equipping you will not be able to adequately minister the riches you possess.

Sometimes you sense you have touched something valuable and precious, but if you are not adequately equipped, you will be unable to minister those things to others.
