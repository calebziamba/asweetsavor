_They placed the ark of God on a new cart that they might bring it from the house of Abinadab which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart._ _â€” Second Samuel 6:3_

David had a cart built for the ark and gathered thirty thousand chosen men to bring the ark into Jerusalem with great honor. It must have been a beautiful wagon. The ark was only to be carried by the Levites (Num. 4:15; 1 Chron. 15:2). That may have seemed too simple to David. However, what God has ordained, God has ordained, and we should not seek to improve it.
