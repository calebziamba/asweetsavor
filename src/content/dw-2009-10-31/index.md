We would all like to be able to conquer others. This is certainly true of the world. Every professor desires to be the recognized expert in his field. They enjoy lifting themselves up against others.Â  This can be true in spiritual things as well. I do not say this lightly. If we gain some spiritual capital, we might use it to subdue others and put them in their place. If we truly desire to serve the Lord, we must never do this.
