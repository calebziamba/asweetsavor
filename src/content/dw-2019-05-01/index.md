_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

This book begins with the declaration, “The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.” Here we see that Solomon’s song is the song of songs. This entire book is of Solomon. All of the stages of life it portrays, all of the experiences it portrays, and all of the serving it portrays are related to Solomon.  
  
This indicates that every stage we pass through is the Lord, every experience we have is the Lord, and every service we offer is the Lord.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, pages 17-18.
