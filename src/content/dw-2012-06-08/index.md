_...That is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ. — Colossians 1:26-28_ Serving ones also have to work with all the saints, teaching and admonishing them while affirming the fact that Christ is in them as the hope of glory. Those who serve must encourage the saints when they seem hopeless, because Christ is in them as the hope of glory, and they must work with the saints point by point in their lives.

If you want the saints to grow, you must be prepared to suffer, for you will have to labor to make up their lack and to fulfill the word. To work with anyone, even the seemingly perfect ones, is a suffering. Every brother and every sister has problems. You have to focus them on Christ, who is in them as their hope of glory, and work with them, teaching, admonishing, and even warning them (Col. 1:28).
