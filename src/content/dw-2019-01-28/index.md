_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father._  
_– Philippians 2:22_

God had approved not only Paul but also Timothy. Even the Philippians knew of Timothy’s proven worth (Phil. 2:22). Because Timothy was approved, Paul had the confidence to send him to the Philippians.

Paul had many coworkers, but it seems that Timothy was the only one who was fully approved. The others sought after their own interests rather than those of Christ Jesus (vv. 20–21). Paul had no confidence that they would genuinely be concerned for the welfare of the Philippians.
