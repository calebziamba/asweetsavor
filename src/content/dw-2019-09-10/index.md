_"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” - Genesis 28:15_

Laban did not have an easy time either. Neither he nor Jacob were joined to God while scheming against each other. Though Jacob was smart, Laban was able to change his wages ten times (v. 41). Though Laban was crafty, he lost his two daughters, his daughters’ female servants, his grandchildren, and his flocks to Jacob. Crafty men meet crafty men. When a man is not joined to God, what will he gain?
