_And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth. — Acts 2:4

“And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream things in dreams.” — Acts 2:17_ Acts 2:4 and 17 tell us how the believers were filled with the Holy Spirit. From the very beginning the Lord’s desire was to fill the believers with the Holy Spirit. If we are dry, dead, without spirit, and not anointed, something is wrong. It does not mean the Lord has left us, but it does indicate the Lord must intervene on our behalf governmentally.

In other words, He must use discipline to correct us. This is abnormal. Take, for example, your own children. You may have to spank them occasionally, but if this is happening every day, something is not right. So our normal growth before the Lord should be in spirit. The Lord ascended so that we could be in spirit.
