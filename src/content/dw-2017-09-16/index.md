_“I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be blameless.”_ _– Genesis 17:1_

God thoroughly knows our inward condition. When He says, “I am the All-bountiful God,” it seems He is saying that though we are unable, He is sufficient to supply all our need, enabling us to walk before Him and be blameless (Jude 24).
