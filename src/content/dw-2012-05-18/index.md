_"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’" Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me." — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

The seeker’s experience here is deeper than before, yet still not a heavenly one. If it were, she would have no more to experience. She still attempts to recover her previous experiences—holding Him and not letting go. She is fearful that the Lord will disappear again if she lets go of Him.

This indicates how we hold on to our experiences. It is not easy for us to lay down our good experiences to receive what is freshly coming from the Lord.
