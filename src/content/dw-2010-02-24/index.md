_And I am no longer in the world; yet they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are. — John 17:11_ The Lord Jesus prayed that we would enter into this same oneness that He and the Father enjoyed. How will this happen? We should know that three things are needed. First, we need life. Second, we need a healthy living. And third, we need to become a testimony.

John 17:11 says, “That they may be one even as We are.” This refers to a oneness in life and nature. Because we have the same life and nature as God, we are able to love one another despite our age or cultural differences. Since the Father and the Son share the same essence and element, we brothers and sisters also share this same essence and element. This is why it becomes easy to love one another even though we are very different. An old man and a teenager have this one life in common, so they are able to enjoy each other, and this principle extends to all the different saints.
