_Surely I have weaned and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child rests against his mother, My soul is like a weaned child within me. â€” Psalm 131:2_

Before a child is weaned, he is very demanding. He will cry for milk at any time. Once he is weaned, he becomes very restful. He knows that the milk will come, so he is quiet. For the psalmist to become like a weaned child means that he is now a quiet, restful person. He knows how to behave properly. He has calmed and quieted his soul.
