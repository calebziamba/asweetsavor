_“The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’ Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me.” — Song of Songs 3:3-4_

When we look at her condition in chapter 1, we can realize that she was self-satisfied even when she testified, “Our couch is green and so are our cedar and cypresses. Our love is green and full of freshness and hope. I am a lily, while others are thorns. The building of the church cannot take place without me” (cf. 1:16b-2:2). She was so self-satisfied that she didn’t realize the meaning of humility and obedience.
