_But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them. And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus. —2 Timothy 3:14-15_

When Watchman Nee encouraged people to purchase two different Bibles, it was difficult for people to afford two Bibles. Today, however, most can easily afford many Bibles. We should have a Recovery Version, a King James Version, and a Darby Translation.We shouldn’t think that because we have a Recovery Version we don’t need any other Bibles, even though the Recovery Version, because of its text and footnotes, is the most valuable. We should use it for our daily reading and in the meetings. But for our study and understanding, additional translations can be of help.

The King James Version is a good version of the Bible. Its value to the English language is like that of the Chinese Union Version to the Chinese. English readers cannot ignore it. Darby’s translation is also valuable. His is a very careful translation, but it does not match the King James Version in literary style. Darby’s Bible also contains footnotes. His footnotes are not as abundant as Brother Lee’s, but they can be inspiring. These three versions are indispensable. Besides these, you should also have a Greek-English Interlinear Bible.
