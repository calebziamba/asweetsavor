> “for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and _also_ for the _life_ to come.”
> 
> 1 Timothy 4:8

You exercise godly exercise to be covered with the Lord’s presence. You exercise to experience Christ in your weakness. Even on very subjective matters, you experience Christ. Then, you learn to attach yourself to the brothers, you learn to live for the saints.
