> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 2:14-16, KJV

Brothers, _this_ is gospel preaching. If you were to ask Paul, “Apostle Paul, how do you preach the gospel? Would you give us some training?” He would say, “Training? Simple. Go live in the Lord's presence and make yourself a savour and let God smell you all the time with the wonderful fragrance of Christ! Then what? Then, forget about the rest. Forget about the rest.”
