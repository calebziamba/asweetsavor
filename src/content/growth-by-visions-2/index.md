> I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 12:1 (NKJV)

Your growth is not by nature or talent. You may say, “I am gifted, I am talented.” But this doesn’t mean you have growth, that you have Christ, that you can grow in the Lord, or that you can be used by the Lord. No. It is not by your nature or talent.

Nor is your growth by personal abilities. You may be able to do a lot. You could be a capable person, able to manage  
many things or people. However, all this ability does not bear high value in following Christ, unless it is supported by the visions and revelations you have received from the Lord.

Nor is your growth by wisdom or brightness. You could be bright, able to read the Bible very well. You could also be  
wise, able to see things. But no matter how bright or how wise you are, these don’t count.

Dear saints, what is crucial? It is your faithfulness to the visions and revelations given to you by God.
