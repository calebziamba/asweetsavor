Once a full-time serving brother came to me about taking up a job. I asked him why. He told me that financially he could no longer afford to be full-time. Every time he went out to eat with others he got nervous, for he often did not have enough in his bank account to cover the check, nor did he wish to use his credit card for fear of piling up debt.

I told him, “Brother, unless the Lord supplies you bountifully, do not use your credit card. In this way, you will have more opportunity to pray, for you will have to rely upon the Lord.”
