_Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches. Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?_ _– 2 Corinthians 11:28-29_

Even though it is common for a believer to stumble, Paul was full of feeling at every instance. He burned with indignation.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 147.
