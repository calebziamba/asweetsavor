We might think David should have feared that God was leading him into a trap, in telling him to attack the Philistines, since he had done things condemned by God (2 Sam. 5:13, 21).

This is sometimes our feeling. There are times when the Lord asks us to do something for Him after we have just been defeated. We may feel to say, “Lord, let’s do it tomorrow, not today. I am afraid if I do it now, it will fail because You are punishing me.” But God works with unworthy men. In spite of his flaws, David was a man after God’s heart. Therefore, God worked with him.
