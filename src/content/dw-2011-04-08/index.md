_We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places — Ephesians 6:12

Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. — First Peter 5:8_

Do we realize there are powers in the air that use the earthly organizations around us? Even the places we shop are under their influence. When we walk into a store, we are walking right into one of Satan’s traps. We all have to live on this earth, but when we walk into a mall, we shouldn’t become his prey.

Remember, “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour” (1 Pet. 5:8). We must maintain a sober mind and be clear in the Lord’s presence. While we shop, we should realize we are touring the realm of the satanic rulers and principalities. We are not here to be devoured by them; we are here to wrestle them!
