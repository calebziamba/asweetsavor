_“As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” — Joshua 24:15b_

I have seen this declaration hanging on the wall in many homes. Many young people make this declaration even before they have a family. Those who have been married awhile have a little more realization and may declare, “As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord...somewhat.” The older we become, the more difficult it is to make Joshua’s declaration because we know what is involved. Yet it was not in his younger days that Joshua declared this but at the end of his life. He was not defeated as most find themselves at his age. Instead, backed by years of experience, Joshua was able to declare with assurance, “As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord!” Joshua understood how much was involved in this declaration. He had learned many difficult lessons while serving for forty years in the wilderness under Moses, then leading Israel into the good land.

Everyone likes to hear the stories about Joshua leading the armies of Israel into battle to conquer the good land, but few pay attention to the years of learning that prepared Joshua for this. However, if we wish to fight for the Lord as Joshua did and to declare with Joshua that we will serve the Lord, we need to pass through what Joshua passed through and learn the lessons that he learned.
