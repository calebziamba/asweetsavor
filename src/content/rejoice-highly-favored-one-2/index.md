> And having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, highly favored _one,_ the Lord _is_ with you; blessed _are_ you among women!”
> 
> \- Luke 1:28, NKJV

When you are saved, you are joyful. When you touch the Lord, you are joyful. When you enjoy the Lord’s presence, you are joyful. When you partake of church meetings, you are joyful. By the Lord’s mercy, when listening to this message I hope you can also say that you are joyful, because the grace of God is coming to you. “Rejoice” means may you really enjoy grace sufficiently. Grace upon grace will come to you.
