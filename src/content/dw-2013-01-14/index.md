_“You are altogether beautiful, my darling,_ _And there is no blemish in you._ _Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:7-8_

If we are willing to stay in the mountain of myrrh to experience the Lord’s death, and in the hill of frankincense to experience His resurrection, He will call us to be with Him in His ascension.

First of all, the Lord tells her, “You are altogether beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you” (4:7). In verse 8,  for the first time, the Lord calls her “My bride.”

The Lord calls to her, “Come with me.” This indicates that the Lord has a calling. His intention is to call us upward to move with Him in His ascension.
