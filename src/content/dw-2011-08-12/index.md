_“You shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them, until the Lord has given your brethren rest, as He gave you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving them.” — Joshua 1:14b-15b

_This is a good principle for us to follow today. If one church is in need, it is too easy for those in another church to say, “We cannot afford to send anyone, for our number is too small.” However, if they stay and do not help in the fighting, their own church may suffer loss. If, however, they go, the Lord will gain the glory.
