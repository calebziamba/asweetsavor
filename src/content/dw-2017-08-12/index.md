_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

God had called Abraham, and he served God for the rest of his life. Yet in the end, he didn’t even have land to bury his wife (Gen. 23). Abraham didn’t complain, saying, “Where is the land You promised me? I have been dwelling in this land, but I don’t own any of it.” He knew that the God who appeared to him was more precious than His promise. He was directly related to God from the beginning to the end. He had nothing but God.
