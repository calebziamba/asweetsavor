_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_ _– John 1:29_

The more we enjoy this Christ—that is, the more we experience the Lamb—the more our sins are taken away.

We should have this experience all the time. On the one hand, sin is a very serious matter, and if we fall into sin we need to deal with it in a serious and thorough way. On the other hand, when we are so much in the enjoyment of the Lord’s presence, we completely forget about our sins; we even forget that we are a sinner.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 75.
