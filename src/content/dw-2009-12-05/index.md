_“Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight. Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking." — Ruth 3:2-3_

In chapter one of the book of Ruth, Ruth gave herself according to what she had seen of God. In chapter three, she gives herself according to the God whom she has experienced. Don’t you have something of the Lord by this time? Do not bring your natural being, your natural man, your natural talent, or your natural zeal to the Lord in your effort to please Him. You must prepare yourself with what He has constituted of Himself into you.
