_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

_How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard._ _– Hebrews 2:3_

The book of Hebrews gives us a very good picture of salvation, even calling it “so great a salvation” (2:3). It tells us that Christ has become “to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation” (5:9). Salvation comes from Christ. He is the author of our salvation (2:10), and we are those who will inherit salvation (1:14). As we draw near to God through Christ and He continually intercedes for us, we experience this salvation (7:25).
