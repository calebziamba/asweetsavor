_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. —Philippians 2:16_

Through Paul’s ministry, others became lights, and in this he would have his boast. We need to see and experience the body of Christ as Paul did. Some people’s view of the body is that we all conform to the same practices. When we really see the body, however, we will not emphasize such things. Instead, we will run in such a way that all the other members of the body are blessed.
