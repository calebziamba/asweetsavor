_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

God allows Satan to test every work of His. God allows Satan to attack those whom He has worked on. If your hair isn’t made with gold, then Satan will not seem to notice you. But just when you are willing to go on with the Lord a little, Satan will come to God to accuse you, and suddenly many things will happen. Do not be discouraged. Your experience through such difficult times will produce in you a golden crown.
