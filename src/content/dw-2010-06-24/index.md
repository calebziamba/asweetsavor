_If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? — Psalm 130:3_ Before we love the Lord we may not think we are so evil. We may even feel quite good about ourselves. But after we love the Lord for many years, we realize that were it not for the Lord’s mercy we would be capable of any sin. There is not even one sin that we are not capable of committing. Were it not for the Lord’s saving hand we would be vulnerable to any temptation. The Lord is the one preserving us, upholding us, strengthening us, and forbidding us to fall.
