_I rejoiced when they said to me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah! — Psalm 122:1_ Psalm 122 begins with a healthy fellowship. The ones who spoke to the psalmist did not talk about other things. Their fellowship was only concerning the house of Jehovah.

Today, the Lord's house is the church life. In our experience, the vision of the church life began with God's grace. By God's grace, out of God's government, we were able to meet a few saints who really loved the Lord and who loved His testimony. When they came to us, their declaration was simply, “Let us go to the house of the Lord!” This fellowship brought us into the church life.
