_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

Sometimes you feel that the cross is too heavy to bear and that you are treading the wilderness on barren, thirsty ground. However, after every suffering, a little more of the crown is developed in you. Besides the Lord, others around you can also see this crown, which indicates that you have grown during this period in your life.
