_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._ _— Philippians 2:5–7_

Paul told the Philippians, “With humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves” (Phil. 2:3) and, “Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus” (v. 5). He pointed them to our Lord, who humbled Himself and took the form of a slave, becoming obedient to the point that He submitted to the most humiliating death: that of the cross (vv. 5–8). How is it possible for us to be “of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose” (v. 2)? It is by letting this mind be in us.
