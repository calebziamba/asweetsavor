_And the Lord said to Samuel, "Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being king over them.” — First Samuel 8:7_

The Lord wanted to be Israel’s king, but when they refused Him, He gave them another as king. In doing so, however, He intended that He would be the king over that king. This required a man after His own heart.
