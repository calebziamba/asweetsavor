_For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death._ _– Romans 8:2_

First, Christ comes to us as the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Second, Christ is life in our spirit (v. 10). Third, He wants to grow from our spirit to our mind to become the life in our mind (v. 6). Finally, He even wants our mortal bodies to be revived by the dispensing of His life (v. 11).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 10.
