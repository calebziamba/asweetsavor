Some brothers poison other saints through their ministry because they are occupied with work and are full of ambition. You may not believe there could be such ones among us. However, I have seen a brother bring something impure into his serving and poison others without their knowing it. This was due to his personality.

Such saints are infatuated with themselves and don’t see what they are doing. On the one hand, their speaking can supply others with the spiritual riches. On the other hand, their attractive kind of leadership can easily attract people to their showy display.

If you were to ask them, they wouldn’t admit that they are poisoning others. Instead, they would say that they love the Lord, follow the Lord, and have the Lord’s commitment and leading. How can this be? It is a problem in their personality.
