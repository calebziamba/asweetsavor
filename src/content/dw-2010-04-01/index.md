_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

The best way for us to handle a difficult environment is to tell the Lord, “Lord, this is what I need. This is exactly right. I agree with what You have arranged for me.”

This is not always easy. Perhaps we are being unfairly criticized or condemned by someone. Our attitude should still be, “Yes, Lord. I need this. I agree with Your plowing work.”
