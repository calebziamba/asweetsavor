_“The Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys.”_ _– Genesis 24:35_

The Holy Spirit is always ready to testify of the Father and the Son. The servant testified of the great riches of Abraham and the position of Isaac as the inheritor of all that his father has.

The Spirit’s testimony is the most precious thing when we follow the Lord. If our focus is our Christian work, we will one day lose heart when the zeal is gone. The Lord Jesus is most precious. He is unsearchable. The more Christ is revealed to us by the Holy Spirit, the more precious He becomes to us. We feel He is so lovely and valuable.
