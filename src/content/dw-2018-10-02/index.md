One day while they were fellowshipping and praying together, Barnabas and Paul were sent out under the direction of the Holy Spirit (13:2–4) and raised up a number of churches. Later they decided to go back to visit the churches they had raised up (15:36). Unfortunately, Paul and Barnabas disagreed over whether or not to take Mark with them. Ultimately Paul took Silas and headed north through Syria and Cilicia, while Barnabas took Mark and went to Cyprus (15:37–41).
