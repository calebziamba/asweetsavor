_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

We need the Lord to purify us. Why do we feel those we serve are more important than others? Why do we hold onto our service so tightly? Because we have a concept that we should hold onto what God has put in our hands. This is wrong. We shouldn’t replace God with His gifts. What God wants to give us is just Himself.
