_You were dead in the trespasses and sins, in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience._ _â€“ Ephesians 2:1-2_

The Bible tells us that before we were born again, we were in death. Sin and death are closely related. Romans 5:12 says,

_Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned._

Because we were in sin, we were also in death. To say that we were in death, spiritually speaking, means that we had no feeling towards God. That is why Ephesians 2:1 says,

_You were dead in your trespasses and sins._
