_For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son._ _– Colossians 1:13_

By being born again, we entered into a new kingdom. As we have already seen, God transferred us into “the kingdom of His beloved Son” when we believed (Col. 1:13). We have left the dark, satanic kingdom behind, and our wonderful new position is in the kingdom of the Son of God’s love.
