_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren._ _– Romans 8:29_

That God was even willing to dispense Himself into us—those who were finite, fallen, sinful, and enslaved—is truly marvelous. Though we were only sinners, He has given us His redemption and is incorporating us into Himself. In the picture portrayed in Romans, God continually works in us until He has fully shaped us according to His eternal will.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, pages 11-12.
