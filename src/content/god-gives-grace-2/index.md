> But the angel said to him, â€œDo not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.

> \- Luke 1:13

Is your Christian life according to a pattern you have grown accustomed to? How can we have a life truly living according to the age of grace? We need a vision! Ask the Lord today if your current pattern of life is pleasing to Him. Allow Him to shine light on the way you interact with Him, with the brothers and sisters, and with the church. May we all have visions and revelations to bring us into the reality of a life lived by the grace of God.
