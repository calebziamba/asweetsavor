_Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”_ _– Genesis 24:58_

_Though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory._ _– 1 Peter 1:8_

Rebekah had never met Isaac, yet she was willing to leave everything to follow once she heard the servant’s testimony. To us this sounds crazy. No woman would consent to marry a man unknown to her based on the word of a third party. Yet Rebekah said, “I will go!”
