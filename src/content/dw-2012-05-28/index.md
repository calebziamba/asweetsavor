_“I held on to him and would not let him go Until I Had Brought Him into My Mother’s House  and into the Chamber of Her Who Conceived Me.” — Song of Songs 3:4b_

In this passage the seeker is entering into grace (“my mother’s house”) and life (“the chamber of her who conceived me”) more deeply. Here “mother” refers to grace (Gal. 4:26). Now she feels that everything is due to grace, not due to her ability or faithfulness.

Her experience here is deeper than when she was in the banqueting house. Her realization of the Lord has become different. Although this is not an experience in ascension, it is in the clefts of the rock and is a spiritual advancement. She is no longer limited in her own enjoyment and work, for now she realizes that her relationship with the Lord is by grace.
