_“Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.” — Acts 2:36_

Peter’s declaration is final, saying there is now One who is Lord of all. In Christ’s ascension there is One over all problems. He is King of kings and Lord of lords. He is reigning over everything.
