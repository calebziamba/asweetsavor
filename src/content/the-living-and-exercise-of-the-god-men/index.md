The eternal economy of God is the controlling vision of the Bible. Everything is based upon God’s dispensing of life to His chosen and redeemed people. To carry out His economy He needs God-men who in their living are increasingly being constituted with the divine attributes. These God-men are also exercised as stewards able to minister the healthy words of God’s economy.

When we talk about God's economy, we should be in the reality of it. It is like talking about Jesus - if we have received Him, we talk about Him differently than a nominal Christian does. In the same way, when we talk about God's economy, we must not be in it "nominally," but rather touching its reality.

Jesus has divinity, and He also possesses humanity. He has all the divine attributes as well as all the human virtues. He is the complete God and the perfect man. He was the first God-Man, and He became the prototype of all God-men, who are the reproductions of Christ Himself. If in your experience the divine attributes are expressed in the human virtues, you are a God-man.

The exercise of a proper steward involves being a teacher, and to be a proper teacher, you need to exercise as a soldier, an athlete, and a farmer. Such a teacher is a true workman who is able to cut straight the word of the truth. Therefore, a workman is a teacher, and a teacher is a workman.
