> Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them
> 
> Luke 2:8-9a

It’s amazing that the first unveiling in the New Testament of Jesus as the Messiah (Christ) was to a group of shepherds. The vision was not to the scribes and Pharisees, who were well-versed in the Scriptures, nor was it to the priests serving in the temple, but this vision of the Christ was revealed to a small group of shepherds who had a flock, who were out in the wilderness, and who were keeping watch over their flock at night. These shepherds were faithfully tending their flock even in the nighttime. They were faithful to what they had been committed with. And because of that pure and simple faith, God showed them such a glorious vision.

Inspired by [Message 5 – The Shepherds in the Field](https://youtu.be/utZiANP_jA0?t=417) of the video message series [Visions & Revelations](http://english.thechurchincleveland.org/virtual-lords-day.html) by Titus Chu
