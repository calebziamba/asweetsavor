_Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And Saul said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” — First Samuel 28:11_

Saul’s experience could apply to us today. If we do not experience a living Christ, one day we may find ourselves standing beside the grave of a Christian we used to look up to. Some visit the graves of spiritual men, and though they are not able to call these men up, they feel comforted telling the dead one the problems they seem unable to tell God. May the Lord preserve us from such an end. How we need to know the living Christ today!

We should practice to know the Lord and to have His presence in big and small matters—our education, our work, our career, our marriage, our family, whatever we face. Tell the Lord, “I do not want to end up praying at someone’s tomb; I want to learn to know You as my Lord in everything. Lord, I want to have Your speaking for the rest of my life.” We each must experience Jesus as our living Lord.
