> Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,  
> So is my beloved among the young men.  
> In his shade I took great delight and sat down,  
> And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
> 
> \- Song of Songs 2:3

Here she speaks of “my beloved among the young men.” The “young men” refer to all the things that seek to capture her heart. Among so many things that are desirable and attractive, her beloved holds the first place in her heart.
