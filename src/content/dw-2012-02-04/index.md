_"O my dove, In the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_

Brothers and sisters, this is the beginning of an arduous journey. Your Christian life eventually requires you to have a union with the death of the Lord. Every day the cross should work in you as you experience the Lord’s word in Matthew 16:24, “If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.” We need to grow together with Him in the likeness of His death, if we are to be with Him in the likeness of His resurrection (Rom. 6:5).
