_“You are a garden spring,_ _A well of living water,_ _And streams flowing from Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:15_

_So then death operates in us, but life in you._ _— Second Corinthians 4:12_

Brothers and sisters, you have to know the spiritual principle that we gain life by experiencing death. We have to go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, that is, until the Lord comes back and we are raptured.
