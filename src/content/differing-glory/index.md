> _"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory."_
> 
> _1 Corinthians 15:41 NASB_

The glory you have is based on: Do you love the Lord more? Do you have Christ more? Do you enjoy Christ more? Do you enjoy Christ as your life? As your supply? As your strength? As your wisdom? As your empowerment? As your goal of life? As your daily living? If you do, then glory rises. This star and that star are different; this glory and that glory are different, but the Lord desires you, dear brother, and you, dear sister, to be a star that is saturated with Christ—saturated with the life of Christ.
