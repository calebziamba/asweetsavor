_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

According to Song of Songs 1:4, our King brings us into “his chambers,” that is, a place where we can fellowship with Him and enter into a relationship with Him that is beyond words. When we have this kind of fellowship with the Lord, we can’t describe it to others, but only to Him. This is the experience of the chambers.

The more we have this experience, the more we are able to walk in the way of the Lord. As those who love the Lord, we will each have our own unique experience of the King’s chambers. Our experience in this regard is for no one else. In this place, the Lord reveals things that are only for us and Him to know.
