_“Surely I will not enter the tabernacle of my house, Nor lie on my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:3-5_

_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is_ _For brothers to dwell  together in unity! — Psalm 133:1_

How is it possible for us to experience the oneness described in Psalm 133:1? We can only be one by exercising our maturity as portrayed in Psalm 132, in which Christ becomes everything and we disappear.

In other words, we can only have the genuine oneness when we lose our individuality. When we are no longer individuals, when we no longer have anything for our selves, then together we can become the Lord’s habitation in which we dwell together in unity. This is to have the display of maturity.
