_"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all scented powders of the merchant?"_ _— Song of Songs 3:6_

We often consider that everything given by the Lord comes in the principle of grace. We need to realize that our maturity is obtained by being perfumed with all the fragrant powders of the Lord.

In a sense, it is true that we do not deserve to acquire these elements, but unless we pay the price to buy them from the Lord, we cannot obtain maturity in this age. If we are unwilling to pay the price, we cannot be matured. When we pay the price, however, all the blessings in Christ become our reality.

May the Lord have mercy upon us so we can pray, “Oh, Lord, grant that I may pay the necessary price. Grant that I could buy everything that You have for me.”
