Before we were born again we were children of wrath and sons of disobedience.Â  John 3:36 says,

_He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him._ Who were we before we were born again? We were just children of wrath and sons of disobedience, those who disobeyed the Son (Eph. 2:1-3). This was our nature and position by birth.
