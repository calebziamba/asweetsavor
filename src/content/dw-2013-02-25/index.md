_“You are a garden spring,_ _A well of living water,_ _And streams flowing from Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:15_

_So then death operates in us, but life in you._ _— Second Corinthians 4:12_

From Song of Songs 4:5 we see that the Lord’s seeker is full of the life supply. She is a fountain in gardens, a well of living water. She is not only helped by others, but she also co-labors with them. Since she stands submissively in the heavenly state, she becomes a life supply even to those who are experienced, with gardens and fountains. She is so rich that she can meet the need of everyone. The church testifies that she is a person of the Spirit.
