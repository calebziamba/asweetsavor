We need others’ help and assistance to develop a good personality. In other words, one aspect of exercising occurs in our relationship toward others. This exercise is definitely not outward, but inward. If you grow well inwardly, your exercise is useful. If you don’t grow, your exercise is useless. If you don’t have Christ, no matter how genuine you are, you are still a person without Christ. However, if you are not genuine, exact, and strict, even though you have Christ, you still cannot manifest Him.
