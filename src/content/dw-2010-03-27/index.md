_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

Today there are many young people among us who love the Lord. Young people are often so “complete.” This means that they do not have many furrows. They do not have the mark of the Lord’s workmanship, or a sign of the Lord’s dealing with them. They have an objective Christ but not enough of a subjective Christ. When such young ones bring in a blessing it is out of their ability, not out of their person.

Some people are so capable that it seems they don’t need to be broken. There are many Christian workers on television. How many of them have furrows? They may be very effective, and they can get thousands of people saved, but they can never build up the church. They serve the Lord according to their ability and their talent, but not according to their person. Their person is untouched and unbroken.
