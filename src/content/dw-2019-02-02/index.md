_But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition._  
_– Philippians 2:19_

One church that I visited regularly was in a troubled state. As I visited them, I was concerned that my own soul would also become troubled and distracted. After a few years, I began to see encouraging things there. They were growing well, and that encouraged me.
