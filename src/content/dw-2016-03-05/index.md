_The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown._ _– Genesis 6:2, 4_

It is easy for us to search for ways to do things without relying on Christ. We may feel led of the Lord to have a special gospel event or church outing, and yet our planning and doing may be entirely our own effort. We are trying to accomplish a spiritual goal without Christ. This is mixture. The Lord indicated that we may even study the Bible and still miss Him (John 5:39–40).
