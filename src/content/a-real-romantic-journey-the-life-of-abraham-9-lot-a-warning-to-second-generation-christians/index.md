> _Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, to the South. 2 Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 4 to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abram called on the name of the_ Lord. 5 _Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents_

_“I become rich by following the church life.” Don’t think I’m joking with this statement. Lot followed Abram. Whatever he had was from Abram. Abram became wealthy, and Lot became wealthy too. It’s interesting; in the church life, even when you’re with the older brothers, you like to have your own riches. Everyone wants to have something. You don’t realize that Lot should have full appreciation towards Abram. Abram treated Lot like his son, as the young lord of the house. Lot should have an appreciation that, even when Abram messed up, Abram became rich and Lot became rich \[because of that\]._ 

_But Lot is very different. Abram got developed; Lot got spoiled. They both got rich, but Abram had something from God. Abram would look at all his riches and say, “I hate this. I can’t believe how selfish and low I am. These riches expose how poor I am.” But Lot was very happy. He would say, “These are mine, not my uncle’s. They are in my account. They are mine.” This is a picture of two men. Lot was happy, but all this would just remind Abram: “Shame on you.”_

> _6 Now the land was not able to support them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together. 7 And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land. 8 So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife between you and me, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are brethren. 9 Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.” 10 And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar. 11 Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And they separated from each other._

_Now I’ll use this chance to tell you something about Lot: Lot was a righteous man, even in the sight of God, so he’s not as bad as you think. He’s a typical second-generation Christian. The problem with them is that they get a lot, but they never did anything to deserve what they got. When Lot looked all around and saw the good grass, he took the whole thing! There were no other fields left for Abram. I tell you, the second generation can easily be proud and think they have something. It’s too easy for young people to think, “We have it,” and begin to challenge things. But don’t challenge for challenge’s sake. \[That\] has no value. “I don’t like this, I don’t like that.” No, there’s no value. What is valuable is challenging when you have enough and you consider, not “Uncle, you’re wrong,” but rather, “Lord, what can be better? What can be better?” So when you’re young, get into the Word, experience Christ, learn to be in the church life, and learn to be under authorities._ 

_I worry about you young people because nothing with you is real. Did you get somebody saved? Have you helped somebody to love the Lord? Are you related to older families? Are you related to younger families? Are you among the saints and giving life? I keep asking you brothers these types of things. You even get tired of it, and you ask me to drop these kinds of things, but I can’t! Because you brothers know too much. You know too much, yet none of it is real. You are Lot._ 

_Do you think Lot did anything? No. But he was with his uncle. And his uncle was blessed, so in turn, he was blessed. Then he turned and started counting how many sheep he had. You keep on counting. You have the feeling that you’ve been through a lot already. Brother, no. Go to the field. Get someone saved. Tell people, “If no one is saved through me, I won’t eat. If no one is saved through me, I will have no joy. I don’t want to have a lot of knowledge, think I get it, and then use the church as my capital to do things I like.” Otherwise, you will only ruin the church._

_Every brother is precious before the Lord. Second-generation Christians should have high self-appreciation. “I’m a young brother or sister, but I know clearly that 30, 40 years later I will become a pillar of the church.” Can you say this? Dare you say this? Brothers, 30 years later, you will be 50 or 60. The church will be on your shoulders, but are you even able to get one saved? Or are you only good at preaching? If that is the case, it is hopeless!_

_Lot had no realization of a spiritual fight. Neither did he realize that without Abram, he didn’t have anything. You brothers have learned so much, but please remember that all of this is because of the faithfulness of the older generations. They struggled and paved the way for us to go on._

As a second-generation Christian, I realize that these kinds of exhortations can be discouraging or hard to take, but I pray that we can have the ears to hear and the eyes to see what the Lord may be trying to reveal to us through these words.
