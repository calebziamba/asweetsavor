Joshua had demonstrated his readiness to take the people into the land. However, he remained an attendant to Moses for the entire time they wandered in the wilderness.

Being as manifested as he was, this was probably not easy. In fact, this must have become the hardest lesson of all for Joshua. If it had been one of us, could we have done it without complaining? As Moses became older, do you think Joshua ever had the thought, “When will this man die so I can fulfill my destiny?”

Ambitious people always think about how they can get to the top. Rarely do we find someone as capable as Joshua who is willing to serve as he did. He continued to learn, and when Moses died, Joshua was able to rise up and say, “Let us go and take the land.”
