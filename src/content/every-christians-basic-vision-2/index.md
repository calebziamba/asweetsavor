> And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
> 
> \- Acts 2:21

With this vision, we have the understanding that Christ is the savior. With this vision we have the understanding that I am a sinner. With this vision we understand that outside of Jesus Christ's salvation and his saving power, we have no hope â€“ we will go to Hell. Lord save us. Now, these together become more revelation. This revelation is called the revelation of Jesus and his salvation. I see Jesus. I see the salvation of Jesus, He's the savior, He died for me, I am a sinner, I live in sin, I grow up in sin, my person is constituted with sins, but God has mercy.
