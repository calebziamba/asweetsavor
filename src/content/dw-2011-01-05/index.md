_Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman)._ _— Numbers 11:27-29_

Moses married an Ethiopian woman. Aaron and Miriam could not handle it and spoke out against him. If Joshua had joined them in their rebellion, he possibly would have become the new leader of Israel. Joshua could have said, “Hallelujah! I don’t have to be a tent keeper anymore. I will rise up and throw my soldiers behind the revolt. Then I will be the leader!”

This was the most dangerous trial Joshua had gone through. However, because of all he had learned, he did not say one word. Joshua trusted his leader and remained submissive. He had learned not to undermine the one who had helped him and raised him up.

There is no record that Joshua reacted at all to Moses’ marriage. We also must be so careful concerning God’s government. The leaders God has placed among us all have faults, but we must not touch such things. If we pass this test, God may grant us some manifestation, as He did Joshua.
