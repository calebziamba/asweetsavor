_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._ _— Philippians 2:5–7_

The context of these verses is that Paul was dealing with the need of the believers. He presented Christ as the unique pattern. Often we hold onto our own interests at the expense of others’ interests. Christ, however, possessed the unique treasure of being in the form of God. Although Christ, as God, was eternal, rich, and unlimited, He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, “a thing to be seized upon or to be held fast, retained” (Thayer, p. 74). Instead, He “emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant” (v. 7) for the sake of the church. This is the mind of Christ.
