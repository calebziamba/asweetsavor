_Even when we were dead in offenses, God made us alive together with Christ; by grace you have been saved. â€” Ephesians 2:5_ Three marvelous things happened to us when we were born again. First, we received a change of life. The life of the Triune God came into us and revived our spirit. Second, we received a change of position. We were no longer earthly, but we were seated with Christ in the heavenly places. Third, we received the necessity of a changed living. We were born into the Body of Christ to live the Body life. These were the three wonderful results when we were born again. The moment we received the Lord everything changed in an instant. Our life, our position, and our living became new.
