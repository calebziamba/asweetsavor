_Blessed be the Lord, Who has not given us to be torn by their teeth. Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the trapper; The snare is broken and we have escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. — Psalm 124:6-8_

When we first follow the Lord, then the world comes in to despise us. But when we are for His testimony, the world rises up against us. The world attacks us in three ways: as a beast to devour us, as a flood to overwhelm us, and as a trap to ensnare us. How can we escape the world? The psalmist declares, “Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth” (v. 8).

This is the conclusion not only of this psalm but of the previous one as well. Psalm 123 had no conclusion. It ended with our being despised by the world. Psalm 124 is the continuation of Psalm 123, and it ends with this wonderful verse. When the world despises us, threatens us, or compels us, where does our help come from? From the One who made heaven and earth. Praise the Lord, He helps us. Our help is in the name of the Lord. Because of His help we can escape and overcome the world.

This is our second consecration. After our first consecration to the Lord Himself (Psalm 123), we need the further consecration of being separated from the world so that we can be His testimony.
