_Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all. â€” Colossians 3:11_

Let me illustrate in this way. Before I came to the United States, I thought I knew what the United States was, but my concept was primarily drawn from movies. From watching movies, I knew that in the United States money was relatively easy to come by, for it never seemed an issue. Then one day I acquired my visa and actually came to this country. At that point, I began to actually enjoy the United States. When I first came, in 1963, a soft drink cost ten cents, and a hamburger was little more. Yet because of my background, I was shocked that Americans would spend so much money on a soft drink. After being here for 40 years, however, I myself might spend a couple of dollars on a cup of coffee and not even finish drinking it, because I have enjoyed the riches here. The substance of the United States has become my reality.

With the Lord it is the same. Before we were saved, we heard things about Jesus. We heard of His doings and His teachings, yet we were far away from Him. Then one day we actually entered into Him through faith. At that point we began to enjoy Christ first-hand, and we began to actually participate in His riches, because our place, or position, had changed. Now, based on our new position, we are able to enjoy Christ directly. No longer do the things we hear about Christ seem to refer to someone who is far away from us. Now we enjoy Him as those who have been transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love (Col. 1:13).
