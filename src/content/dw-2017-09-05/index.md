_“What will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”_ _– Genesis 15:2._

Do not think it is spiritual to simply mimic the outward behavior of those who are spiritually mature. It is like a parrot mimicking the voice of a human being but lacking the human life. When we begin to follow the Lord, we all present an Eliezer. We have a long way to go in the process of gaining God Himself. We see a vision and begin to walk. We need the light of God to see our condition. As we grow in life, we recognize our condition and spontaneously no longer rely upon our natural concept. This is why Eliezer never became a problem to Abraham.
