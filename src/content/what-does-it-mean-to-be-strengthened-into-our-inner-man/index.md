This message is the fifth message given during the January 2009 [Jesus Loversâ€™ Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/)

According to Ephesians 3:16, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. But what does it mean to be strengthened in this way? It means, first of all, that Christ is not merely a power to us, but also a person. Therefore, to be strengthened in such a way means that we take Christ as our person; He begins to penetrate our entire being, so that who we are expresses the person of Christ, and we desire what He desires.
