> "And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus. ... The angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.

The second great miracle is the birth of Jesus. The birth of Jesus is not from men nor of men, but is from the Holy Spirit--from God himself as the power so that God can become man. He is man, but has a divine nature. He is man, but has divine attributes. He is man, but he is God. He said, “If you see me, you see the Father. My Father and I are one. I am just God.”
