 _And David was dancing before the Lord with all his might, and David was wearing a linen ephod...._

_So David said to Michal, “It was before the Lord, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel; therefore I will celebrate before the Lord._ _— Second Samuel 6:14, 21_

I hope we all might declare, “Lord, I want to be like David and dance before you with all my strength, to satisfy Your heart.”
