_The dove came to him toward evening, and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth._ _– Genesis 8:11_

Every day we need to have that day’s freshly picked olive leaf. Do not go back to yesterday’s portion. We need to tell the Lord, “I want a fresh portion from You for this day.” The freshly picked olive leaf tells us that God is leading us. We should not remain in our past experiences. We need to live a new life and experience Christ in a fresh, living way. This makes us fresh, and God is able to gain what He desires.
