A given brother may have a strong disposition. This kind of disposition plus his character may manifest itself in a tough personality. When he insists on something, he is not open to compromise. This kind of brother cannot coordinate with others. If he wants to speak for 20 minutes, it is impossible for him to speak for only fifteen minutes. It is very hard to co-labor with such a brother.
