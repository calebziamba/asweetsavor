_You are My friends if you do what I command you._ _– John 15:14_

Because the Lord Jesus is truly our Friend, we can talk with Him about everything. He has an ear to listen to every problem that we have, whether large or small. First Peter 5:6–7 says,

_Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; pages 76-77.
