_Until the cool of the day When the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense. — Song of Songs 4:6_

At this time the maiden experiences a full union with the Lord. She is the Lord’s satisfaction, and her beauty wins His praise.

She is no longer satisfied with her own experiences or focused only upon her own fellowship with the Lord. Because she has experienced the work of the cross, she is able to receive the Lord’s praise without becoming excited or proud.

She knows that her earlier experience, “My beloved is mine and I am His” (2:16), was sweet, and the banqueting house was very rich (2:4). However, she also realizes that apart from the experiences of myrrh and frankincense, she cannot be matured.
