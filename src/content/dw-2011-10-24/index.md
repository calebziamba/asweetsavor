_After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying: “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. — Joshua 1:1-2_ Joshua had been prepared and trained by the Lord. After the death of Moses, Joshua was ready to serve in his place. The children of Israel were now ready to cross the Jordan, enter the good land, and confront their enemies. Their first three confrontations would be with Jericho, Ai, and Gibeon. In each case, Joshua had to learn to follow the Lord, the true leader of His people.
