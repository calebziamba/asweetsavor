> And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
> 
> \- 1 John 5:11

The Christian life is so wonderful, for regardless how you try to overcome this life, it cannot be defeated! If you try to starve it, it will not die. In fact, when we have forgotten Him, He generates to stir up something within you, so that something spontaneously flows out of you when you least expect it.
