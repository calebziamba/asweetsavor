_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Once, after watching my interactions with different people and noticing how I handled various situations, a businessman told me, “If you were not serving the Lord full time, you would be a successful multimillionaire.” To my realization, however, this is not true. If I have any wisdom or ability, it has all come from this salvation. In business, such a salvation is not required, yet it is this very salvation which has produced who I am today.
