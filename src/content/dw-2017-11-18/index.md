_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

Even Bible knowledge can lead to impurity when used to puff up the self (1 Cor. 8:1). Blamelessness has to do with our outward living, while purity has to do with our inward condition. Being blameless can be something of religion (cf. Phil 3:6), but purity can never be of religion. A pure person is one focused on Christ and Him alone.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 124.
