_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith._ _– Philippians 3:8-9_

The book of Philippians is very focused. Every person needs to be focused. Suppose a man wants to be a musician. He decides that the guitar is the easiest instrument to learn, so he starts taking lessons. After a few days his fingers hurt, so he gives up. A man who isn’t focused will go nowhere.
