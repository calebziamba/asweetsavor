Following the Lord is not merely a matter of desire or life. Whether the Lord can use you or not depends upon your personality. Your personality determines your effectiveness before the Lord. It is precious to have a personality that is useful to the Lord. Take care to develop your personality so that you can be a proper vessel for the Lord.
