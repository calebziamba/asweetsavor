_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _— First Corinthians 3:6_

The first mark of those who regard others as more important than themselves is the realization, “I am inadequate. Because of this, I cannot have any selfish ambition.”
