_“Now it is true that I am a close relative; however, there is a kinsman closer than I. Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the Lord lives. Lie down until the morning.” — Ruth 3:12-13_ We know our natural man by its desires. What your natural man and my natural man are pursuing may be very different things. We will each pursue what we see as being in our own best interest. If we are bright, our natural man will point us to certain things. If we are ambitious, it will cause us to pursue other things. If we are lazy, it will find us another avenue. The many different fields in the world have developed in response to all the different kinds of people with their abilities and interests. In this way, the world corresponds to the natural man.
