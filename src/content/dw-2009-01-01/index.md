_Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. — John 11:25_

_He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything. — Colossians 1:18_

The barley field in Ruth 2 (see verses 2 and 23) signifies the church, which is full of resurrection. This resurrection is just Christ, the Head of the church (John 11:25; Col. 1:18). No other person can or should replace Him. The whole sphere, atmosphere, and scope of the church must be nothing and no one but Christ (Col. 3:11). We should all love this "field." On the one hand the local church life is so frustrating, yet on the other hand we have to say, “Praise the Lord! In the church life there is Christ as resurrection.” The reality, element, and operation of resurrection saturates the church life. It is here that all the aspects of resurrection can be realized.
