_I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman. — John 15:1_

_I am the vine, you are the branches. — John 15:5_ It is crucial for us to realize that we are one with Christ as the branches of the vine, because the vine is a corporate matter. We were not just born again as individuals. In the vine, there are many branches. We were born again into the Body of Christ, into a corporate expression of all His riches.

We have received the necessity of a new living, the enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Christ in all His riches for our daily life, the more we become part of the corporate expression of the Body of Christ. This is to enjoy Christ as the true vine. We will cover this matter more thoroughly in the next chapter.
