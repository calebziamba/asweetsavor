_“Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? Where do you make it lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?” —Song of Songs 1:7_ When we start to love the Lord, we all have the feeling of wandering alongside the flocks of her companions, for we don’t yet know what it is to cooperate with others and to fellowship in the Body.

Our wandering alongside the flock is due to our being very subjective. We touch the love of the Lord subjectively, and we think we know how to follow the Lord. However, we still have a great lack. We have experienced the Lord’s exposing, but we haven’t yet experienced the working of the cross. Hence we feel, “Where is the right place for me? Where can I function?”

Not until we experience the Spirit’s breaking will we realize that others are experiencing exactly the same thing that we are experiencing, and that others feel the very same things that we do. Because we are so subjective, however, we do not see this; we only see our own situation. Therefore we are not able to cooperate with others or to receive the direction in the Body.
