_And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. â€” Acts 2:42_

We should forget our notion of what it means to break bread, because there was nothing legal or formal in the first century. Most likely certain saints came together to have dinner, and then they broke bread to remember the Lord. This seems clear from reading First Corinthians. We have our way today, and this tradition probably started with the Roman Catholics. But regardless of this, breaking bread and praying took place day by day.
