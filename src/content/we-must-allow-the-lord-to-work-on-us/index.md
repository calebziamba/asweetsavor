Just as the lampstand was made of hammered work, so we must deal with the Lord's dealing with us if we are to grow in Christ. No one can truly serve the Lord without the experience of the Lord's hand being upon them. Also, as we read the description of the lampstand in Exodus 25, we can see that on its shaft there were 4 sets of bulbs and blossoms, but only the first 3 of these sets produced branches. From this we see that the final blossoming was for God alone, not for His work.

This excerpt is taken from the July 2016 Summer Vision Week training in Cleveland, OH. This training was focused on the Golden Lampstand of the Tabernacle, as described in Exodus chapter 25.
