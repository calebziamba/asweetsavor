_For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad._ _— Second Corinthians 5:10_

We will all stand before the Lord one day. What we do today is our preparation for that day. We will each be rewarded according to what we accomplished in this life.
