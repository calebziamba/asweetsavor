Isaac went here and there and made mistakes, three of which were serious. His first mistake was his thought of going to Egypt because of the famine. God stopped him, saying,

_“Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of which I shall tell you.”_ _– Genesis 26:2_

He went to Gerar instead. God saved him from going to Egypt, which represents the world.
