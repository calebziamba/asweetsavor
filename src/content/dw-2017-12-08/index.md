_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

With the material world comes the boastful pride of life (1 John 2:16). Others may brag about their cars, shoes, or other things, but our boast must be in the Lord. As others prominently display a certain brand name on their clothing, we must bear Christ. With us there should be nothing called success or satisfaction outside of Christ. In our living we should be content as long as we have Christ.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 127.
