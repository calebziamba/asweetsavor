_“As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” — Joshua 24:15b_

Many cry out in frustration, feeling they cannot live a victorious Christian life of serving the Lord. Yet surely the Lord is with everyone who has believed in Him. In fact, He is the One who initiates our desire to consecrate ourselves to Him and serve Him. If we want to serve as Joshua served, we must cooperate with the Lord to learn the lessons Joshua learned.
