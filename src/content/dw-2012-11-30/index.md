_For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. — Second Corinthians 5:10_

Saul became consumed with jealousy, but this is not how he began in the Lord. Though David suffered much because of Saul, he still blessed the men of Jabesh Gilead for what they did to honor Saul in death. David recognized that Saul would still have something before God because of his faithfulness to what was committed to him while his heart was still right.
