_So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai. And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent; therefore the hearts of the people melted and became like water. — Joshua 7:4-5_

This defeat was not a small thing. The Lord had always given the children of Israel the victory. At Jericho, the enemy’s defenses had crumbled before them. At Ai, however, they were routed by the enemy. Why? While battling the powers of the air (Jericho), we need a bold declaration. As we shall see, however, in battling the world (Ai), we need a clear separation from the world.
