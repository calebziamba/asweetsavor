_“For why should I be like one who veils herself_ _Beside the flocks of your companions?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

The “companions” here are those who surround her and are constituted with a rich ministry in the Lord. However, if these serving ones are not careful in their serving, those whom they serve could become their own flock, rather than the Lord’s flock.

Originally the church life was very satisfying to this seeker, but now she doesn’t know where she should go; she feels that there is no place for her. These “companions” care about everyone else, yet they ignore her. This is why she ends up wandering beside the flocks of the companions of the Lord.
