_"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_

One’s countenance is his outward appearance, and his voice is the inward presentation. The Lord wants to look upon us both outwardly and inwardly. He likes to know us in both aspects. He desires to enjoy both our countenance and our voice.
