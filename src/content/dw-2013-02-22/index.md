_“Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates_ _With choice fruits, henna with nard plants,_ _ Nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,_ _With all the trees of frankincense,_ _Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:13-14_

These verses tell us this garden is filled with choicest fruit. There is henna with spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. All of these are produced from the seeker’s experience of the mountain of myrrh and the fragrant powders of the merchant (3:6).
