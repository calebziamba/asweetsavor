_Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord._ _– Genesis 13:18_

If we don’t have enough experience of God’s provisions—God’s strength (Shechem), God’s house, the church (Bethel), and the fellowship with God (Hebron)—we will fall into a situation in which other things become our life—a school, an occupation, or our Christian service.

We need to live in a tent and not be rooted in one place. We should always be looking to the Lord as to where He would lead. Those who live like this are valuable to God and are blessed. To live like this, we need God’s provision and supply. We need to learn to live in tents, not rooted on the earth but in God, waiting for His command. Then the Lord will have a way with us.
