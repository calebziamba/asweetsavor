_There is Solomon’s bed._ _Sixty mighty men surround it,_ _Of the mighty men of Israel._ _All of them are wielders of the sword,_ _Expert in war;_ _Each man has his sword at his side,_ _Guarding against the terrors of the night. King Solomon made for himself a palanquin_ _From the timber of Lebanon._ _He made its posts of silver,_ _Its bottom of gold_ _And its seat of purple fabric,_ _With its interior lovingly fitted out_ _By the daughters of Jerusalem._ _— Song of Songs 3:9-10_

Before the Lord returns, He first needs a bed where He can rest, and then He needs a palanquin, in which He can be carried where He wants to go. The bed is for the Lord’s rest in the night, whereas the palanquin is for His move in the day.

We may think that one day we should be carried by the Lord. However, those who love the Lord eventually will carry Him. If there is no one to carry the Lord on the earth, He cannot move. The move of the Lord is carried by those who love Him and are absolute for Him. We who love the Lord must be not only His bed, but also His sedan chair for the sake of accomplishing His move on the earth.
