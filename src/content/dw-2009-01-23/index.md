_And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know. — 1 John 2:20_

_And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him. — 1 John 2:27_

We should be those who know how to remain under the Lord's anointing. The anointing comes through the Lord Himself. If we are those who know how to remain with the Lord, we will be full of His anointing. To be with the Lord is to neverÃ‚Â  be “dry.” When we are under the Lord's anointing, we have the Lord's presence.

If we sense that we are dry, we can regain the Lord's presence and anointing by calling on the Lord's name, reading the Bible, or singing a hymn. We should not be believers who know nothing of life. Those who know the anointing know life. If we desire to prophesy in life, we must know the anointing.

We all need to realize that prophesying apart from life is not prophesying at all. Some speak in the meetings and think they are prophesying, but in reality they are just talking as they would anywhere else, except using different terminology. If we do not know the anointing, the teaching of the anointing, or the supply of the anointing, we will be unable to follow the Lord and we will not be able to minister for Him.
