_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”_

_Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;_ _We found it in the fields of Jaar. Let us go into His tabernacle; Let us worship at His footstool. Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, And let Your saints shout for joy. — Psalm 132:1-9_

In his seeking after the reality of the Lord's testimony, the psalmist continues, “We will go into His tabernacle; we will worship at His footstool” (v. 7). Here we see a very significant progression in this psalm, from “the tent of my house” (v. 3) to “His tabernacle” (v. 7). Formerly the psalmist spoke of “the tent of my house,” with “the couch of my bed.” But now, because of his struggling, the substance and reality of God’s tabernacle has been gained. This means that to the psalmist there is no more “I.” There is no more “my house” or “my bed.”
