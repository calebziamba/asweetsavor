_But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of every part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. — Ephesians 4:15-16_ In the church life, if we realize the heading up in the church, we will have a godly fear. We will be fearful that we might offend God. We who have been raised in a democratic society always like to find out “why.” Jesus never asked “why.” He did not need to wait for God to exalt Him after resurrection, yet He waited on God. According to our understanding, He had already accomplished everything, so He had the right to ascend to the heavens. Instead, He waited. We can see Christ's godliness when Mary tried to touch Him in the garden. He told her, “Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father” (John 20:17). Apparently He was waiting for God's order to ascend.

This kind of heading up is how the church is produced, and the exercise of this heading up is how the church will be built up. This is not cheap. Just consider how Christ came down to earth. He lived as a carpenter. He died on the cross. After He resurrected, He waited for God's order to ascend. Then He was put on the throne and given the name above every name. His being headed up was not cheap. In the same way, the church is not produced in a cheap way. It requires a heading up.
