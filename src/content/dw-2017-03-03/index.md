_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

Only those in fear and trembling work out this salvation. Without this fear, we reject His salvation too easily. Like those in the Lord’s parable of the great supper, we use the necessities of our daily life to excuse ourselves from answering the Lord’s call (Luke 14:18–20).

We do not realize what we are rejecting. We do not see that in all matters we need to be saved. How we need to work out our salvation with fear and trembling!
