_For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation. â€” Galatians 6:15_

Every saved person has two lives. Our first life is that which is begotten of our parents. We have received another life, however, at the time of our regeneration. At that time something divine came into us, an element that produces the church. This is the new creation, not in the sense of time, but in the sense of element and essence. What is of God is always fresh and new.
