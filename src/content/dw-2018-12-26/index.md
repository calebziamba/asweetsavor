_The Lord appeared to him the same night and said,_

_“I am the God of your father Abraham;_ _Do not fear, for I am with you._ _I will bless you, and multiply your descendants,_ _For the sake of My servant Abraham.”_

_So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well._

_– Genesis 26:24–25_

Isaac often made mistakes, but God wouldn’t let him go. I am afraid he only did two things right in his life. First, because Rebekah was barren, Isaac prayed for her and she conceived (Gen. 25:21). Second, when God appeared to him, he built an altar and pitched his tent there (26:24–25). Besides these two things, it seems he didn’t understand the will of God.
