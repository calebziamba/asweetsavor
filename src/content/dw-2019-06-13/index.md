_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

Whatever we love is our king. If movies ravish our heart, then movies are our king. If novels ravish our heart, then we are giving novels the right to rule over us.

However, if the Lord has ravished our heart, then spontaneously He is our King. As the hymn says, the change of authority from everything else to Christ comes from

_Not a sense of right or duty,_  
_But the sight of peerless worth._
