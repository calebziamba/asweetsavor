_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

How we need to hate this age! Look how many are ensnared by it. Though many believers initially set their sights on the Lord and His purpose, few are able to live a life that matches this goal. The attractions and comforts of this age prevent them from obtaining the crown of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:7–8).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 127.
