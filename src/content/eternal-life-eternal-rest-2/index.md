> we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
> 
> \- 1 John 5:20b

\[In\] this unlimited life, you have the omnipresent One and the omniscience One. He is always there and He knows everything. Even in the middle of your improper behavior God is right there. God is sitting with you as you are watching television, and saying, “What a naughty boy.” God is there. Do we have the realization that we have such a Savior? This is our Savior. This is our Lord. We worship Him that He is the eternal life.
