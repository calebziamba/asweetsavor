_Then she said to the king, "It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. Nevertheless I did not believe the reports, until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. You exceed in wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard."_

_— First Kings 10:6-7_

In my fifty years' experience of following the Lord, He has never come up short. I am continually amazed at Him. We cannot exhaust His riches. We have a song that says, “The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure store, and every day He's dearer than He ever was before.” Many strive diligently for years in a particular area and eventually become experts, but as to Christ, we can never say that we have done more than scratch the surface. Even though I have been pursuing the Lord for half a century, I still feel I have only entered the gate. The Lord has riches prepared for us that we will be receiving and appreciating throughout all eternity.
