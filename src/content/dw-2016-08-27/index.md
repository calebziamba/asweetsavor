You need the mercy of the Lord so that He doesn’t put you beside a “garbage dump” while you are growing. The most dreadful thing is when the brother beside you is desirous, zealous, and experienced, and yet he speaks garbage, talks about garbage, and cares for nothing but garbage. It takes away all fear of the Lord and godliness. In such an environment it will be impossible for you to grow.
