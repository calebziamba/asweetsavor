_“I am the rose of Sharon,  
 The lily of the valleys.”  
– Song of Songs 2:1  
_

Brothers and sisters, do you know the Lord as the Lord of the lilies? You are a rose of Sharon and a lily of the valleys, and yet, although you are nobody, God cares for you. Although you are nobody, God is responsible for you and wants to accomplish His work through you. You are not a potted plant that others must care for, but a “rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys,” and it is God who cares for you. He will continue to hold you until you can truly testify that you are a lily of the valleys.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, pages 71-72.
