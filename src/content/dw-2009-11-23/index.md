_How blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah, Who walks in His ways. When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, You will be happy and it will be well with you. â€” Psalm 128:1-2_

At the beginning of Psalm 127 we labored in vain. Now in Psalm 128 we eat the labor of our hands. Because we have slept, and because we have been equipped and prepared unto every good work, we can rise up and serve the Lord effectively. Then we can enjoy the fruit of our labor.
