_My daughter, shall I not seek some rest for you, that it may be well with you? — Ruth 3:1_ In this passage Naomi says, “My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?” Naomi was concerned about Ruth's state. She cared for her security, well-being, and development.

Some care for others by merely bringing them into programs. They try to get them plugged into something. That is not the way that Naomi took care of Ruth. She sought what was best for her according to her particular need, considering what was profitable to Ruth. We each need someone to love us in this way.
