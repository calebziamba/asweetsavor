We have become the members of Christ, as the members of His body. There are several verses which tell us this. Romans 12:5 says,

_We, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another._

First Corinthians 6:15 says,

_Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?_

First Corinthians 12:12 says,

_Even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ._
