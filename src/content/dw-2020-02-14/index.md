_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

The dogs Paul referred to were the Judaizers, the Jewish religionists. However, when it comes to religion, we all have some dog element in our nature. Therefore, we should not be quick to point our finger at others. Rather, we must first apply this word to ourselves

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 180.
