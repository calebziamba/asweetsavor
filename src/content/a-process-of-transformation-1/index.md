> And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what _is_ that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
> 
> \- Romans 12:2, NKJV

How do you know you are transformed? First, come to your mind. Your mind is settled, right? I want to be a doctor. I want to be a millionaire. I want to be a CEO. I want to be a teacher. I want to be a professor. Or, I want to just be a family man. I just want to be with my wife and my children. There’s nothing called right or wrong. There’s nothing wrong with being a doctor. There’s nothing wrong with being a rich man. There’s nothing wrong with being a family man. But, let me ask you this question: is this what the Lord wants? Is what you want, what the Lord wants? I served the Lord with my capacity. I see a millionaire, he can also serve the Lord with his capacity. I see a professor, he can also serve the Lord with his capacity. I see another one who is just a common family man, and he serves the Lord with _his_ capacity. But, we all have one central goal: to find out what the will of God is . Do you realize you can have two kinds of living? Your living according to you or your living according to the will of God. How marvelous is this?
