_For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. â€” John 1:17_ This sweetness is not only manifested in the living and pursuing of those who enjoy the divine stream, but also in their operation. Those who serve in the church must do so in such a way that Christ is manifested. We should not go to the saints in the way of law and regulation. Nothing kills sweetness so quickly as the introduction of law. Regardless of how good our motive or intention is, if we carry something out in a legal way, the atmosphere will not be sweet.

If we are truly enjoying the flow of the divine stream, our operation in the church life will be characterized by sweetness. In a sweet church life, saints feel close to one another and enjoy the nourishing and cherishing in the Body life.
