_This series covers Brother Titus Chu’s recent speaking in various conferences and trainings. This set of excerpts is from a series of messages given during the 2019-2020 Winter Vision Week training. The content presented below is based on notes taken during the meetings._

The first place Abram settled in Canaan is Shechem—strength. When we gain strength, we move to Bethel—house of God—and begin to love the church and appreciate the house of God. Yet, in the west, there is Ai—heap of ruins. This heap of ruins is very attractive. We know Ai has no value, yet we can’t depart from it. We are neither for the church nor for the ruins. Isn’t Abram smart? He built his altar right between the two places. Perhaps he said to the Lord, “I am for you—BUT. I am consecrated—BUT…”

As a result, God took Abram through a famine. In a spiritual famine, we lose the presence and sweetness of the Lord. In response, Abram went down to Egypt. He lied to Pharaoh about Sarai his wife. How shameful of a time that must have been. Yet in the end, Pharaoh gave Abram and Lot so many riches. These riches both became Abram’s shame and caused him conflict. Because he and Lot became so wealthy, they fought over the land. What was Abram’s thought during this conflict? Was he glad to be rid of Lot? Should he have commanded his authority over Lot? Instead, his response was very spiritual. He let Lot choose a portion of the land, and they parted ways. Where is Lot’s humanity? He took the best land from Abram. Like Abram, we may find that the Lord blesses us, yet another brother robs our blessing. Perhaps Abram regretted bringing Lot out of Ur in the first place, realizing that as a result of his leading and raising up, Lot has taken his wealth away from him.

Yet, God promised to Abram the land itself. But with that promise there was also the call to "rise up and walk the land!” God’s desire is so strong. He wants to tell us, “What you have is too small.” There is always more to gain. We may want to stay in Cleveland, or we may have some plan to move elsewhere. We may be able, dedicated, consecrated. Someone raised up by us may desert us, and we may feel like we have lost strength. At that point, we may ask, “What kind of life am I living? What should I do?” God will tell us, “Lift up your eyes! Look northward, southward, eastward, westward.” Do we have ambition? The gospel should go to Japan, the Philippines, India, Europe, Africa, Canada. God’s desire is for all the countries! We will realize, wow, we are so small. Our hearts should be for all this land, yet our hearts are so small. When our hearts are too small, God asks us to “lift up your eyes! Look!” and “Arise! Walk about the land, its length and breadth.” Our view will become very high. How different this is from how Abram might have felt after Lot took everything. Now Abram knew: what Lot says and chooses don’t count. Only what God says counts. God promised Abram all the land. And God desired that he should “rise up and walk.”
