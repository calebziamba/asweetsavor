_Through the Lord Jesus Christ also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God. — Romans 5:2_

_Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. — FirstÃ‚Â Peter 1:3_

Formerly we were in sin and therefore under the law. But after being born again, we are in grace (Rom. 5:2, 20-21). Grace can be defined as the Triune God Himself as our enjoyment. Because our new position is in the Triune God, we are now in a position of grace.

Before we were born again, we were those “having no hope and without God in the world” (Eph. 2:12). But “we were saved in hope” (Rom. 8:24). We have been born again “unto a living hope.”Ã‚Â  (1Ã‚Â Peter 1:3).

We have seen that formerly we were in death, but now we are in life. This means that we are in resurrection. Not only was the Lord Jesus raised from the dead, but we were raised with Him: “But God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved) and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus” (Eph. 2:4-6). “If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God” (Col. 3:1). When we were born again we became one with the resurrected Christ. As those who have passed out of death into life, we also are in resurrection.
