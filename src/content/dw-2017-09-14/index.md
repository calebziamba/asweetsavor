_“I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be blameless.”_ _– Genesis 17:1_

Being blameless before God is not based on our victory but our knowing of our own faults and knowing God as the All-bountiful One. Therefore, some may say, “If that is the case, let’s go gamble and party every day—we’ll still be blameless.” No. That is indulging in lusts. Once we have expended all the strength of our flesh, God comes to reveal Himself as the All-bountiful God. After Abraham failed in his attempt to fulfill God’s promise, God didn’t come to rebuke or comfort him. Instead He revealed Himself as the All-bountiful God and told Abraham to be blameless. How great and how high He is! Only He can do things like this.
