_And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding. — Colossians 1:9_

According to this verse the brothers were praying that the saints would realize that their position had changed, and that they were now qualified to be filled with the full knowledge of God’s economy. Paul also wrote to the Colossians that the Father had qualified them for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light (1:12).

As those who appreciate that our place has changed, we must know that our new standing means that we can know God’s will, and we are now able to possess the allotted portion God has granted to us. Even more, as those whose position God has changed, we are able to conquer the enemy, for we have been transferred out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of God’s love (1:13). This is similar to my being able to enjoy something much higher by leaving my poor country and entering into the United States of America.
