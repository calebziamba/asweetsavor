> I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, all who are mature, let’s have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that to you as well;

> \-- Philippians 3:14-15 NASB

After advancing in our experience of Christ to this point in Philippians, our minds become saturated with one thought: We want to gain Christ! Our goal is Christ alone! Don’t think this is easy... Only the spiritually mature care for Christ alone. Our work must simply become whatever it takes to gain more Christ.
