_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father._ _—Philippians 2:8–11_

Because Christ humbled Himself to the uttermost, God exalted Him to the uttermost. The word “exalt” already indicates being placed on high, so for God to highly exalt Jesus means God super-exalted Him. God has led Him to the highest place.
