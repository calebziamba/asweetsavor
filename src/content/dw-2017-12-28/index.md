The servant asked Abraham, “Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?” (Gen. 24:5). Abraham answered, “If the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath” (v. 8). The old servant was not responsible for the woman to follow him.

The Holy Spirit cannot be responsible for those whose heart is hardened (Rom. 2:4–5). The good news of Jesus Christ is only for whosoever is willing to receive it (Rom. 10:11–13, 16). The old servant took ten camels laden with the riches of his master and went to the city of Nahor in Mesopotamia.
