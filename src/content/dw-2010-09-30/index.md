_Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a kinsman; and may his name be famous in Israel! And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.” — Ruth 4:14–15_ So Boaz and Ruth were finally married, and they had a son, and the women then told Naomi how blessed she was. This book is called the book of Ruth, but it begins and ends with Naomi. She was no longer Mara (bitter), for now she was truly blessed. Through Boaz, both Naomi and Ruth were blessed. Naomi even gained a restorer of life in her old age.

If we follow the Lord, we should never be discouraged. There is always something of the Lord to sustain us. Ruth herself became better to Naomi than seven sons. The Lord would much rather have one such overcomer than seven churchgoers.
