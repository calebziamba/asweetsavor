_He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering.”_ _– Genesis 22:2_

When God called Abraham to leave Ur, He said, “Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you” (Acts 7:3). At that time he was to leave everything and have no one but God. By the time he offered Isaac, taking the knife to slay him, he had no one but God. He put everything behind him.

At that moment, he might have recalled how God called him out of Ur and Haran and all the hardships he experienced along the way. God’s promise of a seed had been fulfilled in Isaac, but now it seemed even this was in vain. He could only follow God’s demand and offer back to God what God had given him.
