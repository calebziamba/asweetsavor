_And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the people there, for the people of Ai are few.”  
— Joshua 7:3  
_  
The second city that Israel battled was Ai (Josh. 7). When Joshua and the children of Israel came to this city, they forgot to seek the Lord. They spied it out and concluded that a few thousand men could take it. When they went to battle, thirty-six of their men were killed and Israel’s army took flight.
