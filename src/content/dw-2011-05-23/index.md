_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

As we come to the last stage of the Psalms of Ascent (Ps. 132-134) we should remember that these psalms contain very few teachings and doctrines. However, they are rich in experience. For this reason what we have been sharing should not be taken as a doctrinal expounding of the Bible. Other writers and expositors have interpreted these psalms differently, but our desire is to share these psalms according to spiritual experience.

In our Christian life we are ascending from one stage of experience to another. We have already covered the stages of vision, consecration, enjoyment, and enlargement. Now we come to the fifth and final stage, the stage of maturity.
