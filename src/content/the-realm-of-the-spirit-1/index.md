It is a fact that we live and exist in the divine and mystical realm today. Therefore, we must take care that all of our spiritual labor is in this realm. In this realm, the Spirit is always able to supply us, support us, and strengthen us, no matter what situation we are in. Therefore, we should actively partake of and enjoy the Spirit.
