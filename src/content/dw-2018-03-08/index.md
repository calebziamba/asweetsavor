_“Every man serves the good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.”_ _– John 2:10_

The Lord, who is the “good wine,” is better than all the wine, or satisfaction, the world can offer. Christ Himself is the highest satisfaction. Nothing in the world compares to Him.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 93.
