_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

A single blemish in a precious stone mars its clarity and causes it to lose much of its value. This describes us. Often we start out in a pure way, wanting to be a useful servant of the Lord. Then, as our service to the Lord is appreciated by others, a blemish of pride grows and spots of self-appreciation accumulate. Eventually, instead of being transparent, we become opaque.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 124.
