Here, Titus Chu first speaks to the younger saints, encouraging them to spend time in the Word, to really know the Bible, so that they may become solid in their Christian life. He then goes on to speak to the older saints, encouraging them to be enlarged to consider the Lord's interest as a whole, not only the needs of the church in their own locality. One very practical way to do this is to take the time to visit and encourage the saints in the other churches.

This excerpt is taken from the July 2016 Summer Vision Week training in Cleveland, OH. This training was focused on the Golden Lampstand of the Tabernacle, as described in Exodus chapter 25.
