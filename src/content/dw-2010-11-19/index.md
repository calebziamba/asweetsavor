_Now in those there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. — Judges 21:25_

_And when He had deposed Saul, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will. — Acts 13:22_ Not one person on the whole earth at that time seemed to care about what God wanted. No one was focused upon God’s heart. Israel’s commitment to honor their own vow not to allow their daughters to marry the sons of Benjamin seemed to be more important than God Himself. Surely they did not know God’s heart. They just did whatever they felt bound to do. The book of Judges ends, “In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes” (Judg. 21:25). What kind of people were these that God called His own?
