_Above all, have fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins. — First Peter 4:8_ If you want to be a person who is after God’s heart, you must learn not to see certain things, or at least to cover them in love (1 Pet. 4:8). If you know how to handle the messiness in the church life, you will grow. In fact, the messy situations are especially for our learning and growth.
