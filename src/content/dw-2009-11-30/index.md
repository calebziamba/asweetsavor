_“Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight. Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking." — Ruth 3:2-3_

_If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. — First John 1:9_ Naomi told Ruth to wash herself. This surely implies the cleansing of sin. For this you must either confess (1 John 1:9) or walk in the light as He is in the light (v. 7). Confess your sins as you come to the Lord, and if He gives you no feeling to confess anything in particular, tell Him, “Lord, I am a sinner saved by grace. I come to Your presence to enjoy You and to partake of You.”
