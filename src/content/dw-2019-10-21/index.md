_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

Because Epaphroditus was able to carry out his practical service spiritually, his maturity was manifested. This is why Paul exhorted the Philippians to hold him in high regard. We donâ€™t all have the same capacity. For example, if I asked someone who drives a truck for a living to give a three-day conference, he may feel scared to death. However, whether or not we can give wonderful messages, we can still carry out our service as New Testament ministers. The value of our service will be in how spiritual we become in the process of our learning to serve, how much Christ we gain in that process, and how much our spiritual exercise becomes a help to others.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 174.
