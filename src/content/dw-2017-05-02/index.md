_Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold. He went on his journeys from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai._ _– Genesis 13:2-3_

Although Abraham’s going to Egypt was his failure, God is grand and could still bless Abraham in that failure. When Abraham came back to Bethel, he was doubly blessed—he was blessed with material riches, and he was blessed with a heart that wasn’t captured by material riches.
