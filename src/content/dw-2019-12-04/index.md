_“While the king sat at his table,_  
_My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.”_  
_– Song of Solomon 1:12, ASV_

What does the king enjoy while he is at his table? He enjoys Christ; the enjoyment is Christ and the food is also Christ. Only Christ can satisfy God. Because of this, it may seem that we are not important when we recognize that the king is at his table; we only accompany him. However, this is not true, for we are not told here what food was set upon the king’s table. Rather, the seeker says that while the king was at his table, “My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.” What Christ has accomplished is not the center here. Instead, what we have become as the result of His work is the center before God. Although it is the Lord who is at the table, we too are there as the result of His work. We are in union with Christ, and the Christ who is being worked into us is living within us and spreading out from us to be the fragrance to satisfy God.
