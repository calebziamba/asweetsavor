_So a young man ran and told Moses and said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"_

_Then Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses from his youth, said, "Moses, my lord, restrain them!"_

_But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord's people were prophets, that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!" — Numbers 11:27-29_

A natural man thinks God’s people must have only one coordinated voice with one teaching. God’s way, however, is always to work according to His Spirit. If I were called to be one of the seventy, I would have done as Moses asked. Yet God is very broad and grand. He uses all such opportunities to develop His testimony.

Therefore, we shouldn’t be so narrow. We may have the Lord’s presence with us, but other Christians do also. We should not judge or forbid others (Luke 9:49–50). Joshua was exposed by Moses as being too narrow. A servant of the Lord must be broad, not narrow.
