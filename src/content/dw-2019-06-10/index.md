_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

“The king,” “his chambers,” and “love” are mentioned here. The ruling in our life changes when we know Christ. Because of love, we now have the King in our heart. He has authority over us because of His love.
