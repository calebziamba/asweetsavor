_Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”_ _— Genesis 1:26_

At the beginning of the Bible, man was created according to God’s image and likeness (Gen. 1:26–28). The unique creation of man was for the purpose of manifesting God and ruling on earth for Him. However, man fell, failed, and departed from the original purpose of God’s creation. This is where the gospel begins—our need. The gospel shows us that we—people who are fallen, failed, weak, sinful, enslaved, fleshly, natural, and lustful—need the gospel of God and the salvation it provides.
