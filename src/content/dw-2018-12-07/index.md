_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

God is watching us and desires to gain us. We were set apart from our mothers’ womb (Gal. 1:15). In His mercy He called us and has become our daily supply and strength. Praise Him! We are the center of His plan and He will fulfill His glorious will through us. Our weaknesses, failures, faults, and even our strengths mean nothing in His glorious will. God has a great work—His eternal plan. The glory and hope in His plan surround us and make our weaknesses irrelevant.
