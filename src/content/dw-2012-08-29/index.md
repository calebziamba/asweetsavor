_“Who is this coming up from the wilderness_ _Like pillars of smoke,_ _Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,_ _With all scented powders of the merchant?”_ _There is Solomon’s bed._ _Sixty mighty men surround it,_ _Of the mighty men of Israel.”_ _— Song of Songs 3:6-7_

The Lord is not alone as He rests, but He is surrounded by 60 mighty men. Sixty is a number that refers to man, who was created on the sixth day. Now the seeking one has the capacity to unite with others who have come up from the wilderness, who are also pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh, frankincense, and all of the fragrant powders. She not only loves the Lord together with these seekers, but she even unites with them as an army.

The Lord can rest because of this army. At this stage, we live in the church life and coordinate with those who have also separated themselves from the world and given themselves to experience Christ.
