A person might be born with a good character, but the natural character is not solid. For example, I was born as one who is genuine by nature. However, to obtain the real genuineness I must exercise.

How do I exercise? Every time I am not sincere, say an inexact word, or play a little politics, I immediately have a feeling, “From now on I shouldn’t behave like this.” If my behavior hurts others, I have to go to them and apologize. I must deal with myself and not allow any untruthfulness to remain in me.
