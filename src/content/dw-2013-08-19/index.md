_“I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them again?” — Song of Songs 5:3_ The Shulammite is indeed now spiritually perceptive. She recognizes the knocking of her Lord’s hand. However, her response is, “I have put off my dress; how can I put it on again? I have washed my feet; how can I dirty them again?”

She doesn’t understand the Lord’s call. Her feeling is that the work is good, that the saints are being helped, and that she has become a garden full of riches for the Lord’s enjoyment.
