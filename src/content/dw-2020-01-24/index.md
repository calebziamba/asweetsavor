_"Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.  
When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket  
of his thigh; so the socket of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated while he  
wrestled with him...and he was limping on his thigh"  
\-Genesis 32:24-25, 31  
_

God will touch the strongest part of our natural ability—what we are best at and surest about, what we boast in and are proud of, and what we have faith in more than God. Spontaneously, our natural ability is diminished. We may still try to use our own ways, wisdom, talents, and gifts, but we find ourselves limping. We try to walk fast but are not able. We can only limp. This is the experience of Peniel.
