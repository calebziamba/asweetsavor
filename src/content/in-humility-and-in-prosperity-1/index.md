> I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity
> 
> \- Philippians 4:12 NASB

Paul knew how to live in both lowly and prosperous circumstances. Sometimes we are so limited financially, physically, or even spiritually, that we can only say, “Lord, what should I do now?” Once I was down to my last dollar, and I went to the store to buy a loaf of bread and some milk. I was so happy I was singing hymns and praising the Lord. An old lady asked me, “How can you be so happy when the prices are inflating like this?” I didn’t answer her, but within me I said, “I’m so happy because I have only one dollar. I have no idea what I will eat tomorrow, but I know the Lord.” Something just rose up, so I knew how to be content in a circumstance of humble means.
