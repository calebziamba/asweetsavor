_After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ attendant,  saying: “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.” — Joshua 1:1-3_ Perhaps if we heard God’s word, “Arise,” after nearly forty years of waiting, we might have replied, “Huh? Arise for what?” Yet Joshua was so clear. During all those years of waiting, Joshua watched Moses and learned of him. When following spiritual leaders, we should simply receive all that they can give us, adding to what we already have. This is how our service to the Lord becomes richer.

Moses was a special vessel (Deut. 34:10), so Joshua could not go beyond him, but Joshua endeavored to receive everything he could from him. God then told Joshua, “Arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people....Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses” (Josh. 1:2–3).
