_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_ When we have grown to this stage of maturity we have a burning desperation. We cry out from within ourselves, “Yes, I see the Lord’s testimony. I see the local churches. But where is the substance of all the things I see? Where is the substance of all the things we talk about? We have heard so much, we know so much, we understand so much, but we are so short of the substance of the Lord’s testimony!”
