"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

_He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets._ _— Matthew 12:19_

What does it mean to cry out? To cry out is to say, “Unfair! Unfair!” With us, our whole existence is strife and crying out over what we perceive to be fair and unfair. We strive to be on the top, and we strive to be more manifested than others. We complain when someone rebukes us. Every opportunity that comes, we strive. When we are together with other brothers we strive with one another. We strive to be somebody, and we strive to be manifested.

However, we must realize that to strive is against the principle of being buried. If you are buried, nobody knows you. Nobody appreciates you. You are dying, and yet while you are dying, you are so alive. You are buried, and yet while you are buried, you are so fruitful. When you live such a life there is no reason to strive or cry out.
