_Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually._ _The Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart._ _â€“ Genesis 6:5-6_

The eight persons from Enosh to Noah represent the eight expressions in our Christian experience. How glorious this is! Yet in the days of Noah, man fell again. God was grieved in His heart, so He worked again to rid the earth of the mixture that frustrated His will.
