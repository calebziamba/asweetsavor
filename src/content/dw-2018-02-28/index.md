_The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth._ _– John 1:14_

As Christians we often ask the Lord for His grace, yet, do we actually realize what grace is? In these messages we have spoken a great deal concerning the enjoyment of Christ. Now we need to realize that this enjoyment is grace. That is, grace is simply the enjoyment of Christ.
