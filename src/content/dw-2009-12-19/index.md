When we speak, we should have the spirit of support and guidance. Therefore, what we speak must be understandable to those who hear us.

If your speaking is too difficult for the saints, your words will not become a support to them or provide them guidance. In order to provide support, your words should be enjoyable, and in order to provide guidance, your words should be applicable. You cannot just speak things that are high and deep. Of course, this does not mean that you should not speak things that are profound, but you must take into account the ability of your listeners to grasp what you share.

If we desire to teach the saints in this way, we must have a spirit of guidance and support rather than a spirit of condemnation. May the Lord have mercy that we all may become constituted with the ministry of life for the perfecting of the saints and the building up of the Body.
