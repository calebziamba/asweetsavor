_And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast \[a\]about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me._  
_– 2 Corinthians 12:9_

We don’t have to walk by ourselves. With each demand there is a rich and full supply (2 Cor. 12:9). The way and the portion will become more and more “an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison” (4:17). The Lord Himself will become our inheritance!
