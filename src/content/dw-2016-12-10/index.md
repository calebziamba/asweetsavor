_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you;_ _And I will make you a great nation,_ _And I will bless you,_ _And make your name great;_ _And so you shall be a blessing;_ _And I will bless those who bless you,_ _And the one who curses you I will curse._ _And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1-3_

Abraham is the father of faith. How God called him, He calls us. The Lord may speak differently to us, but the purpose of His calling remains the same—the fulfillment of His will.
