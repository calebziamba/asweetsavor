_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_

This father-child relationship is also an apprenticeship. During New Testament times, a son generally continued in his father’s footsteps, learning his trade and skills. Joseph was a carpenter, so Jesus was also a carpenter (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3). This same principle is also true spiritually.
