_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. — John 12:24_

_When Jehovah turned again the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream.... Those who sow in tears Will reap with a ringing shout. He who goes forth and weeps, Bearing seed for scattering, Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout, Bearing his sheaves with him. — Psalm 126:1, 5-6_ When the Lord tells us to go and die, and we respond, “Yes, Lord,” then we become like precious seed. We are buried under the ground and out of sight. But then we bear much fruit. We return with joy, bearing our sheaves with us.

Fruitfulness does not come by doing a lot of activities. We only become fruitful by falling into the ground to die. For us to be fruitful we must tell the Lord, “I am willing to die with You. I am willing to bury myself as a seed. I know that I will come back with sheaves, with bountiful fruit for Your enjoyment.” Then the Lord enjoys the fruit, and we do also.

This is much deeper than the enjoyment when we first came into the church. Now we have been released from our self-life. Our captivity has been turned, just as “the streams in the south.” The streams that flow in the desert will cause barren land to become fruitful. When we are freed from our self, we also become fruitful. This is a higher enjoyment. After sowing in tears, we reap in joy.
