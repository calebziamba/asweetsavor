No matter how transformed we are, we won’t lose our inborn nature. Rather, transformation makes our personality holy, sanctified, and it unites us with God, God’s economy, and God’s operation.

I am a man with a strong emotion; even though I am getting old, my emotion remains strong. Our nature will not be converted. I won’t be transformed to the extent that I have no more tears.
