_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_

I was a librarian when the Lord called me to serve Him full time. I could have lived a comfortable life if I remained a librarian. My wife and I both had good incomes. I would have still loved the Lord and served Him in some fashion, but I feared missing “so great a salvation” (Heb. 2:3). The Lord had called me, and I had to follow. To stop short would have been to neglect this great salvation.
