_I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. — Romans 12:1_

_Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus, that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. — Romans 15:5-6_

The one accord comes from the common sacrifice. We all sacrifice ourselves. We all put ourselves to death. Then with one mouth we glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one accord is for praising God together. This is the manifestation of the top joyfulness. We could illustrate with university graduation. All the graduates are full of joy at their graduation, but those who are at the top of the class have joyfulness with celebration.

Many times we focus on being one, preaching the gospel together, laboring together, breaking bread together, and bearing fruit together. However, the real celebration comes from giving honor to God the Father and Christ our Lord. The one accord comes from one person, Jesus Christ. One accord comes with one substance, Jesus Christ. One accord only produces one goal, that is, giving glory to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
