_When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.”_ _– John 21:15_

The third and final commission from Christ in the Gospel of John is found in 21:15–17. That commission is to “feed My lambs,” “shepherd My sheep,” and “feed My sheep” (Darby). From the moment we are born again, we should learn how to feed and shepherd someone. No one is too young in the Christian life to learn this.
