How do we receive vision? It is by means of the accumulation of revelation. To have some amount of revelation does not mean that we necessarily possess a controlling vision. The word of the ministry brings in revelation according to the vision of the speaking one. On our part, we must receive what is being revealed in spirit, for as we do, the revelations will eventually accumulate to the point that they produce a vision within us.

If we want to have vision, first, our spirit itself must be alive; second, we must receive revelation in spirit; and third, we must be constituted with what was revealed. Eventually, the constitution of all our revelations becomes our vision.
