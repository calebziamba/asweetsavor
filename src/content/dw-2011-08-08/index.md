_“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage.” — Joshua 1:9_ It seems as though God was worried that Joshua might have been thinking, “If Moses couldn’t make it, how could I?” The Lord seemed to be telling Joshua, “I love and respect My servant Moses, but you must come out from under his shadow. Be strong and of good courage and go your way!”
