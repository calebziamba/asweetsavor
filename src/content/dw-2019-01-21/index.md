_So \[Isaac\] built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.  
__– Genesis 26:25_

We should desire to live a life of the altar and tent, always ready to move with the Lord. If the Lord is leading us to move and we are unable to follow, we will wither and lose the buoyancy of life. We will become restricted in our ability to supply the church. The Lord will become limited in what He can do through us.
