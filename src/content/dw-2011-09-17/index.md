_So the women sang as they danced, and said:_

_“Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.”_

_Then Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed only thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?” So Saul eyed David from that day forward. — First Samuel 18:7-9_

David’s approvedness introduced him to a life under persecution. Saul tried to kill David, took his wife from him, and even hunted for him after he fled to the wilderness. During the years David was fleeing from Saul, many dispossessed and hopeless people came to him. He worked with them and formed them into a loyal and effective fighting force. David provides us one of the best examples in the Bible of what it means to be chosen, anointed, trained, tested, and eventually approved.
