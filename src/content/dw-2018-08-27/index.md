The seventh and final key item regarding the content of Romans is that it testifies of the universal body of Christ, which is manifested in local churches. When we read Romans, we should not only pay attention to God’s economy, Christ, and God’s work, but also to the body of Christ, which is the church. In Romans 12:5, Paul says, “So we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.” In 16:16, Paul says, “All the churches of Christ greet you.” Chapter 12 begins with the body of Christ, and chapter 16 ends with many local churches. When God’s work begins in us, His goal is to fashion us into the image of Christ so that the body of Christ could be revealed through us corporately in many local churches.
