_Had it not been the Lord who was on our side When men rose up against us.... Then the waters would have engulfed us, The stream would have swept over our soul, Then the raging waters would have swept over our soul. — Psalm 124:2,4-5_

Sometimes we can overcome the world when it comes to us as a beast. We can say, “I don't care about the world! I am here for the church life! I am here for the Lord's testimony!” But then the world comes in a different form, as a flood to overwhelm us.

A beast is easier to handle because it is so obvious. A flood is more subtle than a beast and therefore much harder to resist. The first stages of a flood may even be quite pleasant. At first there may be just a pleasant sound of water flowing, but eventually it builds into an overwhelming flood. The world may come to us with something small, but gradually it overwhelms us until we feel we have no choice but to give in.
