_Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand._ _— First Samuel 25:32_

Based upon Abagail’s supplication, David relented and even blessed the Lord for sending her. Her words reminded him who he was and what his stand before the Lord was.

David’s response was frank; he did not try to avoid losing face. He was a spiritual man speaking with a spiritual woman. He could have said, “It is too late. We have already taken up our swords.” Instead, he told her to go in peace to her house.
