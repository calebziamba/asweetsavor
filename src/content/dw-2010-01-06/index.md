_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine. Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; Your name is like ointment poured forth; Therefore the virgins love you.” — Song of Songs 1:1-3_

Verse 3 goes on to say, “Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance.” The anointing oils refer to the Lord Himself as the One who has passed through all the processes.

When you are still young in the Lord, He is very tender towards you. He gives you His love and you enjoy Him as the processed God. He then becomes oils to anoint you and blend with you. It seems that He forgets His holiness, His glory, His honor, and His might and becomes a humble One, entering into your spirit for your enjoyment, to blend with you. During this process you will enjoy Him and experience Him as the anointing oils, and He will transfuse Himself into you.
