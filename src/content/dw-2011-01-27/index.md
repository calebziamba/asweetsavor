_To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, the called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. — Romans 1:7

Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus, that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. — Romans 15:5-6

_The local church life in one accord comes from the organic salvation experienced by the saints in the local church. In other words, if there is no growth in life, there is no one accord. In chapter fifteen of Romans, one accord is mentioned. But from chapter one onward, there is the matter that you need to grow.
