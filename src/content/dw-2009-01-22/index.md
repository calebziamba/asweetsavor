_God has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. — 2 Corinthians 3:6_ The ministry of the Lord Jesus is the unique ministry in the universe. It is the ministry of the Spirit. This ministry is not outward, and it is not something of mere knowledge or teaching. The ministry of the Lord Jesus is absolutely the ministry of the Spirit. In 2Ã‚Â Corinthians Paul tells us that the New Testament ministry is “the ministry of the Spirit” (2 Cor. 3:8). In the same section he also tells us, “the Spirit gives life” (2 Cor. 3:6). If you do not know the Spirit, you cannot know the ministry. If you desire to know the one Triune God, the unique divine economy, and the one ministry, you must know the Spirit.
