_He who has the bride is the bridegroom._ _– John 3:29a_

The more we enjoy the living person of Christ, the more we will have the sense that we are being betrothed to Him. When we are spending time in the Lord’s presence, we may begin to pray, “Oh Lord Jesus, I love You. Oh Lord, I love You so much! I just want to give You my whole being. Oh Lord Jesus, I belong to You. You are so satisfying. You are so nourishing. You are so strengthening. You are so wonderful, so fresh, and so sweet.”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 81.
