_Even as it is right for me to think this concerning you all because you have me in your heart, since both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all fellow partakers with me of grace. For God is my witness how I long after you all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus. — Philippians 1:7-8_ In verse seven of chapter one, Paul says that the saints had him in their heart, while in the next verse Paul says that he longed after them all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus. On the one hand, the saints truly had Paul in their hearts. They cared about him. They did not feel any pressure when he came to them, nor were they relieved when he left! Perhaps among us some might dread the thought of a brother visiting their locality, and even hope that something might intervene so that he might not come!

We should have the servants of the Lord in our hearts. The servant of the Lord, however, remembers the saints not according to their outward circumstances, but according to the inward parts of Christ Jesus. His concern is in Christ’s consideration towards these saints. When the saints remember the apostles, it is love; when the apostles consider the saints, it is love plus what is profitable for them according to Christ. The apostles go into the Lord’s heart, and according to the Lord’s heart they remember the saints. This is truly a sweet oneness!
