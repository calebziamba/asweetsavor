Approvedness cannot be manifested in us if we handle the Bible with indifference. We must pursue the truth with our whole being. Otherwise, when we begin to minister the truth to others, what we know will quickly be exhausted. Young believers should equip themselves with the truth of the Bible rather than focus mainly on service. How much they can do for the Lord should be secondary to becoming equipped and constituted with the riches of the divine truth.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 140.
