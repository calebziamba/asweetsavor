_All the people who were in the gate, and the elders said, “We are witnesses.” — Ruth 4:11a_ To all this the elders and those present said, “We are witnesses.” Perhaps they did not understand why Boaz would do such a thing. Ruth was young and possibly beautiful, but Boaz was entering into something that would not bring him any profit in the long run, for any child born of their union would be credited to Mahlon. Boaz would have to work for someone else’s profit and raise up a seed for him. How upright, kind, and proper Boaz was! I hope we all would have such a heart to fight for one another’s good rather than simply for our own.
