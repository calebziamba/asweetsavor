_He blessed him and said,_

_“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,_ _Possessor of heaven and earth;_ _And blessed be God Most High,_ _Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”_ _– Genesis 14:19-20_

Through us God magnifies His triumph. Man overcomes through God’s authority, and God magnifies His authority through man’s overcoming. God is Possessor of heaven and earth. Let us tell the Lord, “May I walk in You. I don’t care about my failures, weaknesses, or even my strengths. I only want to walk in You.”
