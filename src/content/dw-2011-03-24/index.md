_“Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, For I am sick with love.” — Song of Songs 2:5_ The church cannot go on without the ones who have the raisin cakes. The more experienced saints there are in the church, the more capacity every brother and sister will be able to develop to enjoy the Lord. The more experienced saints there are in the church, the greater will be the saints’ ability to sustain the enjoyment of the Lord. Praise the Lord! He can help us and work on us through the brothers who have gone before us.
