_Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole Body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. — Colossians 2:18-19_ As we have mentioned, Colossians does not mention the matter of oneness. Rather, Colossians focuses upon Christ as the Head. Paul realizes that Christ is the Person of the one organic Body to bear the one testimony.

I am very happy today that, even though my body may have problems, my head is doing fine. As long as my head is all right, I will be able to operate, for that is where my person is located. When a person succumbs to something such as Alzheimer’s disease, he or she still has a head, but it has lost its vital function.

Praise the Lord that He as the Head never grows old. He is always new, and He is always fresh. When we hold Him as our Head in the church, there is always life, and there is always vitality. Praise the Lord! When we hold Christ as our Head, we have all that is necessary for us to live out the organic oneness of the Body (2:19).
