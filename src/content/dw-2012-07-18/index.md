_Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand._ _— First Samuel 25:32_

Through these events, David met Abagail, Nabal died, and Abigail became free to marry David. Perhaps this was an encouragement to David that the Lord was still with him, even though he was a king without a kingdom.

Later we shall see how the wives of David present us a picture of the church in its process of becoming something of glory. Abigail became the third of David’s eight wives in this sequence.
