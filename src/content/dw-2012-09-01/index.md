_“Who is this coming up from the wilderness_ _Like pillars of smoke,_ _Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,_ _With all scented powders of the merchant?”_ _There is Solomon’s bed._ _Sixty mighty men surround it,_ _Of the mighty men of Israel.”_ _All of them are wielders of the sword,_ _Expert in war;_ _Each man has his sword at his side,_ _Guarding against the terrors of the night.”_ _— Song of Songs 3:6-8_

At this time the maiden manifests that she is in union with the Lord. The world to her is a wilderness. Nothing in it can touch her or capture her heart. She is purely for the Lord, and she lives by His mercy. She unites with the Lord inwardly so that nothing can draw her away or distract her.

Only such a person can be empowered by the Spirit and realize the meaning of the myrrh, frankincense, and fragrant powders. With others she is able to coordinate and be built up. Because of her readiness together with others who are like-souled with her, the Lord is restful
