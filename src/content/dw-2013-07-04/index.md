_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

Paul wrote that he was a bond-servant of Christ Jesus. “Jesus” implies the suffering One, and “Christ” implies the exalted One. A bond-servant of the Lord experiences the suffering Jesus and follows the exalted Christ. Paul could say, “I am enslaved to a wonderful Master—the ascended, exalted, and enthroned Christ—but in my daily life, I experience the suffering Jesus. He was despised, and I am despised. He gained no respect, and I gain no respect.”
