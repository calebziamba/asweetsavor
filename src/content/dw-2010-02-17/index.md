_“Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight. Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.” — Ruth 3:2-3_

We realize that our fallen nature will always be with us until the day we fully enter into resurrection with the Lord. Fifty years ago, I thought that as I grew older I would become very holy and free of defilement. Now, fifty years later, I discover that there is more defilement instead of less, yet I also discover that I have much more of the Lord’s anointing. I have experienced so much cleansing and anointing, and the Lord has given me a colorful garment in the process. This is what we should bring with us when we come into the Lord’s presence.
