_So \[Isaac\] built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.  
__– Genesis 26:25_

We should pray for the Lord’s mercy that we would not become so attached to things that we become immovable. The Lord may lead us to another state, country, or continent. We should be broad minded and tell the Lord, “I live for You. I consecrate myself to You. I don’t have my own choice. I will go wherever You lead me. If it is Your will, I follow.” This is a life of the altar and tent.
