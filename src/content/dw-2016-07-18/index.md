When you touch the Lord in a deep way, your nature and disposition will become different, your person will become different, and your views and feelings will become different. When your nature and disposition are transformed, they also must go through your character in order to produce a good personality. Therefore, you need to exercise your character: exercise to be broad, fine, and diligent so that your character can become useful to the Lord.
