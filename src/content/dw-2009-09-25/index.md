_It is vain for you to rise up early, To lie down late, To eat the bread of toil; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep. Behold, children are a gift of Jehovah, The fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one's youth. How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate. — Psalm 127:2-5_

This experience of transformation can only take place in the church life, because this is the place where we experience the Lord's governmental hand. Furthermore, it can only be retained in the church life. That is why this psalm concludes, “Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them. He will not be put to shame when he speaks with enemies in the gate” (v. 5).
