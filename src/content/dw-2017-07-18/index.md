_He who has the bride is the bridegroom._ _– John 3:29a_

When we pray to the Lord in an intimate way, telling  Him how sweet and how wonderful He is to us, and how we love Him, we will surely feel, “I’m going to marry this One. I’m going to marry this wonderful Bridegroom, Jesus Christ. Hallelujah!” By enjoying the Lord Jesus as a living person in our spirit, we are being prepared to marry Him.
