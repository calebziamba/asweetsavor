_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son_  
_–_ _Romans_ _1:1-3_

A famous hymn says, “Floods of joy o’er my soul/ Like the sea billows roll/ Since Jesus came into my heart” (Martin, #151). In our experience, the gospel brings floods of abundant joy to us without end or shortage. The gospel not only brings us joy, but also quenches our thirst, brings us to the will of God, and supplies us with all of God’s riches. This means that in our lifetime we can never fully experience the gospel or exhaust its supply. Because the gospel is no less than Christ Himself, its riches are infinite. Christ is the all-inclusive and unlimited One, and His unsearchable riches in the gospel are meant for us to experience, enjoy, and pursue lifelong without limits or boundaries.
