_See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ. — Colossians 2:8_ Eventually, the living out of the oneness in the church is accomplished in the living of the saints. In order to carry out such a living, the saints must first realize what the world is, and avoid being carried off by it.

According to Paul, the world can be identified as a philosophy, which is in turn an empty deceit (2:8). The elements of the world and the traditions of men are embodied in man’s philosophies. Philosophies and traditions frustrate us from living in the oneness of the Body, for they distract and carry us off from the oneness.
