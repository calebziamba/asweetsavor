You need a Savior for your future. If you are not a Christian, this is your future: “dust you are, and to dust you shall return” (Gen. 3:19b). As a Christian, the Bible tells us, “Who \[Christ\] will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory” (Phil. 3:21). This transfiguration will occur when the Lord returns. When Jesus comes back, we Christians who are being saved today will experience the transfiguration of our body, from a body of humiliation into a body of glory. This is our Savior.

This stanza from a hymn describes the joy we have in our wonderful Savior:

> _O the joy of having all in Jesus! What a balm the broken heart to heal! Ne’er a sin so great, but He’ll forgive it, Nor a sorrow that He does not feel! If I have but Jesus, only Jesus, Nothing else in all the world beside O then ev’rything is mine in Jesus; For my needs and more He will provide.”_

##### PRAYER

Jesus, You are the Savior. Lord, I desire You to be my Savior. Lord, I need a Savior. I confess my condition to You. I’m a sinner who needs to be saved. Lord, wash me in Your blood. Wash away every sin and iniquity. Lord, save me from the vanity of my life. Save me unto Yourself, Lord. I open to receive You. Lord, I really need You. Lord, come into me and become my life. Lord, I receive You. Thank You, Jesus. Amen.
