_“I am the rose of Sharon, And the lily of the valleys.”

“Like a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.” — Song of Songs 2:1-2_

Seventh, the seeker has come to know herself. She is not self-centered anymore, nor does she have a very high opinion of herself as she did before. Because of the work of God’s grace, she admits humbly that she is but a “rose of Sharon.” She feels she is nothing but an ordinary saint in the church. By the mercy of God, she can go on with the saints.

She also finds out that she is a “lily of the valleys.” Since she has seen the Lord’s faithfulness and love, she is able to set aside all her worries, doubts, struggles, and rash behavior. She now can rest in the mighty arms of the Lord and press on by faith.
