_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

_Now Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has._ _– Genesis 24:36_

Abraham remarried after the death of Sarah and had additional sons, but he only gave them gifts and sent them away from his son Isaac (25:6). “Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac” (v. 5).
