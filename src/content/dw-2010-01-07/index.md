_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine. Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; Your name is like ointment poured forth; Therefore the virgins love you.” — Song of Songs 1:1-3_

Verse 3 continues, “Your name is like ointment poured forth.” This name is actually the Lord’s work. As the result of His work, He has the name that is above every name. According to the book of Philippians, the Lord “humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross. Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name” (Phil. 2:9). The Lord’s name has been produced as a result of all His work. Hence, His name refers to His work.

Initially, when we began to love the Lord, we only sought His love. Gradually, the Lord Himself was constituted into us, bringing Himself into us as the anointing oil. He was so tender, not judging us at all, even though we knew our weakness and sin that were contrary to Him. We also knew of His work, His achievements, and especially His salvation. We knew the Lord who loved us, went to the cross for us, died for us, resurrected for us, and now lives in us to become our life. Now He is our joy, our satisfaction, our enjoyment, our supply, and our strength. What we experience now is the work of the Lord as a name like ointment poured forth. At this point, however, our experience has still not gotten into the depths.
