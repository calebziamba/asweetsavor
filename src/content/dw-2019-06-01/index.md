_“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

These virgins are the reality of the church. No one can see the church apart from the experience of Song of Songs 1:3. We may talk about the church, but it will not be real without the virgins.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 25.
