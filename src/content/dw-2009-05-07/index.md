We must also be constituted with the divine attributes, for divine attributes are the source of human virtues. The more we are constituted with the divine attributes, the more of the divine nature we possess, and the more we can live out genuine human virtues.

Jesus was able to live a life that fully expressed the human virtues because He was fully constituted with the divine attributes. By means of the divine attributes, He lived out a human life that fully exhibited the corresponding human virtues.
