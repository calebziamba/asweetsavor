_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

Sadly, there are not many who keep a secret love with the Lord, a love that is only between them and the Lord. Some may not have a close relationship with the Lord to begin with, while others may be intimate with the Lord but have no real secret with Him. Still others may have such a secret experience with the Lord but reveal it rather than keep it hidden. This shows that we are often more interested in works than in the Lord Himself.
