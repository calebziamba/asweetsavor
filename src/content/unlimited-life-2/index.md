> Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
> 
> \- Hebrews 10:8

In this whole universe, there is nothing that is eternal except God. Even the sun is getting old. The earth is also getting old. ... I am surrounded by things that are becoming old and I inhabit a body that is becoming old, but I do have a God who is eternal and always fresh. Brother Lee wrote a hymn, “O Lord you are the evergreen” just to tell us how young and fresh our Lord is. He is always young and always fresh because He is eternal.
