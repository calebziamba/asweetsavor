_So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed....So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. — Exodus 17:11, 13_ The Bible credits Joshua with the victory even though it was Moses’ prayer that assured it. Is this fair? Joshua’s army either retreated from the Amalekites or prevailed against them due to Moses’ prayer. Within the last few years, some young people have moved to cities in the Cleveland area to raise up new churches. They may seem prevailing as they do this, but their success is only through the prayer of the churches, and particularly the prayer of the older ones. Still, God says, “The young people won the victory!” even though the older ones assured the outcome through their prayer. Without Moses, Joshua and his army may have been chased all the way back to Egypt! Because of Moses’ prayer, Joshua defeated Amalek and was given the credit for it.
