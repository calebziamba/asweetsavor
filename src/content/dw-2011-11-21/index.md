_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

The Lord stands behind your wall. This indicates that He is ready for action; He is standing, not sitting. He stands there waiting for you. As soon as you are ready, He will immediately take action. As soon as you are ready, He will lead. As soon as you are ready, He will take you on another journey. As soon as you are ready, He will bring you on to another stage in your spiritual growth. The Lord is never idle when it comes to your going on. He is always ready to go.
