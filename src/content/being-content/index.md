> ...I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am
> 
> \- Philippians 4:11 NASB

Sometimes we become discouraged, yet every discouragement leads us to an unfailing strength. At such times we might think, “It’s over. I don’t think I can love the Lord anymore.” Yet for some reason, no matter how discouraged and incompetent we feel, there is an unfailing strength within us. The resurrected Christ restores us and becomes our encouragement. This is what it means to be content.

When we begin to fight for the Lord’s interest and testimony, the spiritual combat becomes unspeakably fierce. In the midst of this battle we may feel we should give up. It is like Job’s wife who told him to just curse God and die (Job 2:9). Yet, at the same time, there is an unfailing strength. Every time we think it is too much, something rises up within us, causing us to continue. As we abide in Christ as our unfailing strength, we experience contentment and satisfaction.
