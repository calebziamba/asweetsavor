_He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. — John 7:38_

How can you know if you are in the divine flow? Ask yourself, “Am I free? Is the Triune God growing in me? Are the fruits of the Spirit coming forth? Have I realized who I am, and who Christ is in spite of who I am? Am I living with God's goal and economy in view? Am I pursuing Christ instead of the things of the world? Is the sweetness of Christ's person being manifested in me?” If your answer is yes and your experience is in this realm, then you can know assuredly that you are in the flow of the divine stream.

The flow of the divine stream is thus proven by our growth, our enjoyment, our transformation, and ultimately by our becoming a sweet and fragrant person. All this takes place out of the Triune God's operation, for this divine stream is the flow of the Triune God Himself. Furthermore, the focus of this flow cannot be anything other than Christ, for the Triune God is focused upon Christ. When we say, “We are in the flow,” we are really saying, “We are in Christ.”
