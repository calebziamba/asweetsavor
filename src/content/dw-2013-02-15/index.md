_“Your lips, my bride, drip honey;_ _Honey and milk are under your tongue,_ _And the fragrance of your garments Is like the fragrance of Lebanon.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:11_

When we answer the Lord’s calling, we are in Lebanon—the realm of ascension; we are on the top of Amana—the reality of truth; we are on the top of Senir—the whole armor; and we are on the top of Hermon, in the lions’ den and the leopards’ mountain—we are able to discern the stratagems of Satan. When we come to people as we are in the realm of ascension, we will be full of life and full of supply so that we can revive others. A hymn says:

_“O may my lips drip fresh honey,_ _And may you enjoy the sweetness of my love!”_

As one who loves the Lord and has a rich life flow, we give the Lord enjoyment, for He has gained someone who belongs to Him completely.
