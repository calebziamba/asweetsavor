_Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah._ _– Genesis 20:2_

Abraham’s experience shows us that those who are blameless are not without weakness. They may have severe weaknesses, yet they are able to overcome their failures and weaknesses. Those who are spiritually mature realize they are blameless in the eyes of God.
