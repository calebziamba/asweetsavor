_“If you yourself do not know,_ _Most beautiful among women,_ _Go forth on the trail of the flock_ _And pasture your young goats_ _By the tents of the shepherds.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:8_

“The footsteps of the flock” here are plural in number, signifying the spiritual walk of all believers. From the pouring out of the Spirit at Pentecost throughout all of church history, the real followers of the Lord have demonstrated their love in the midst of persecution, sacrifice, and even martyrdom. Today, many are still following in this way to love the Lord. We need to trace these steps ourselves and continue along this way that the saints have trod before.

The principles of spiritual growth will never change. Just as the Lord helped Peter, James, John, Paul, and many other saints to grow in life in the New Testament age, so will the Lord lead us today. Therefore, when we are wandering alongside the flocks of our companions and feeling depressed, one very good, practical help can be to read biographies of those who have loved the Lord before us. The story of their experiences with the Lord will supply us and help us through our difficulties.
