_And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. — John 8:32_

_If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed. — John 8:36_ How can the truth make us free? This truth is not a matter of knowing things doctrinally. A doctrinal knowledge can never set us free. It is when we enjoy Christ as grace, reality, and satisfaction that we are set free. When we have Christ as our freedom, nothing can bind us. Neither sin, nor the world, nor anything negative can bind us. When we enjoy Christ, we can say, “I have the truth. I have the Son. I'm free!”
