_“I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.’” — Song of Songs 5:2_

Starting from the second verse in chapter 5 of the Song of Songs, the Lord begins to lead His seeker into another stage of experience. Remember, the Lord leads us into what He Himself has passed through and experienced. In this stage He shows us that although He had no sin, He suffered; although He was the King, He was mocked and reproached; and although He was blameless, He suffered the agony of the cross and of God’s judgment. He didn’t deserve what He suffered. He shouldn’t have been mocked and reproached; He shouldn’t have been rejected; and He shouldn’t have been nailed to the cross. He was unappreciated and despised, even though He was the greatest person who ever walked on the earth. What the Lord experienced was infinitely more unjust and unreasonable than what any other person has ever experienced.
