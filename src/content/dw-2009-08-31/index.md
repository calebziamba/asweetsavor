_And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality. — John 1:14

_Christians often pray, “Lord, may Your grace be with us.” But what does this mean? What is grace? We have spoken of our need to enjoy Christ. This is actually the definition of grace. Grace is the very enjoyment of Christ Himself.

We often misunderstand the Lord and assume He is always angry at us. We may even tell the Lord, “Lord, I did something wrong again. Please don't punish me too much.” But we should realize that the Lord is not out to get us. He doesn't have a harsh face towards us. The Lord's face is pleasant towards us. The Lord is full of grace. Grace means the rich enjoyment of Christ Himself. We should not just enjoy blessings from Christ. Many Christians develop a taste for blessings and gifts from the Lord, but they never want the Giver Himself. They don't really want Christ, but they want all kinds of gifts from Christ. That is why their Christian lives are so poor. We must enjoy Christ Himself as the very grace to us. The Lord loves us and is full of grace to us.
