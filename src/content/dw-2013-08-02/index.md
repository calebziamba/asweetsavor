_“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;_ _I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam._ _I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;_ _I have drunk my wine and my milk._ _Eat, friends;_ _Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:1_

In addition to the operation of the cross, the Lord has also gained the rich refreshment of life through her, represented by the honeycomb with the honey and the wine with the milk Where does the Lord gain this supply? He enjoys it from the garden of her heart. Our heart should become such a place of delight to the Lord.
