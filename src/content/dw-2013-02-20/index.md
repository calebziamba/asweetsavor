_“A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse;_ _A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:12_

Your experience here is higher than that revealed in the beginning of chapter 4, where you are united with the Lord, but still free. Now as a garden you have no responsibility but to grow something for others’ enjoyment. As a garden, you have no opinion what should be planted or where and when it should be planted. The Lord is the Master. He will decide when to enjoy your portion. Our Lord is so great that He has many lovers, whom He enjoys one by one.
