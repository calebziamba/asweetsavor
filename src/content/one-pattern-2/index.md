> Brothers _and sisters_, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:17 NASB

Paul did not feel as though any church or work belonged to him. He saw himself as exercising just one part in the Lordâ€™s ministry. This is why he told the Philippians to imitate any who walked in the same principle that he walked. Paul realized that the Lord had one work of ministry and that although he was carrying a portion in that work, he was not that work in its entirety.
