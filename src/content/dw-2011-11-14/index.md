_“He brought me to his banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:4_ Up to this point the seeking one has developed some understanding of spiritual experience. However, the seeker has not progressed upward much in her experience, even though she feels she has gained a lot. From the Lord’s vantage point she is still far off. She has passed through a number of experiences, but hasn’t gone further. She has enjoyed the Lord’s provision. She has come to know the Lord’s love, His fellowship, the cross, His kingship, His life, the church, and even the Lord Himself.

Nevertheless, she is still the reference point in her experience. It is she who knows the love of the Lord. It is she who has fellowship with the Lord. It is she who knows the cross. It is she who allows the Lord to be King. It is she who sees the loveliness of the church. It is also she who realizes that she is black on the one hand, and a rose of Sharon and a lily of the valleys on the other.
