_“Let him kiss me with  
the kisses of his mouth:  
For thy love is better than wine.  
Because of the savour of  
thy good ointments  
Thy name is as ointment poured forth,  
“Therefore do the virgins love thee.”  
– Song of Songs 1:2-3, KJV  
  
_The experience of the five basic characteristics in verses 2 and 3 of the Song of Songs is the beginning of our life of loving the Lord and the basic element for our lifelong pursuit of the Lord. No matter where we are in our growth in life, we must continue experiencing these five items in an ever deepening way.
