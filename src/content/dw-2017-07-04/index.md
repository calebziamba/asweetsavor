_I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep._ _– John 10:11_

When He was on the earth, the Lord shepherded us to the extent that He even laid down His life for us on the cross. Now He is our good Shepherd, even our great Shepherd (Heb. 13:20), in the heavenly places. He has ascended and is enthroned with authority, kingship, and lordship. As such a One, He is shepherding us today.
