_So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants. — First Samuel 18:5_ When we have experiences of being manifested in our service to the Lord, we must tell the Lord, “I am not for this, I am for You. My desire in all this is to carry out what is in Your heart.” The Lord must be our center. He alone must become the reality of our living, our serving, and our daily labor.

We should not be content to simply become good, functioning members in the church life. No! We should fight to have something extra before the Lord. We should desire to become a blessing to the Lord, the church, and the believers we are with. Such an aspiration is precious. If we lack the experience of being manifested, we will lack what has been given to sustain us during the periods of difficulty and hardship.
