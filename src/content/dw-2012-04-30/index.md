_“Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.”_

_“By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.”_

_— Song of Songs 2:17-3:1_

In this section of the Song of Songs the seeker was so satisfied with the sweet experience of the vineyards that she ignored the Lord’s calling. Could the Lord tolerate His seeker’s satisfaction with her past experiences? No. Therefore, He left His seeker.

Although the bed was still there, the Lord’s presence was not. Although she could pray as before, she had lost the sweetness of the Lord’s presence in her prayer. By means of such severe spiritual discipline, we learn not to rest on any past spiritual experiences. Our spirit must closely follow the Lord.
