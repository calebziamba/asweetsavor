_So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling._ _—Philippians 2:12_ _And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him._ _– Hebrews 5:9_

The book of Hebrews gives us a very good picture of salvation, even calling it “so great a salvation” (2:3). Based upon the picture in Hebrews, this salvation begins with Christ as the author (Heb. 5:9); it is worked out during our entire life; and its full manifestation will not be until the coming of Christ (Heb. 9:28). This salvation is “so great”! It is the totality of our Christian experience.stian experience.
