_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves._ _—Philippians 2:3_

According to what I have seen, conceit is not as damaging to the church life as ambition and self-seeking, but it is something meaningless that can cheat the one controlled by it. Sometimes we boast in an experience which we have had and others have not. We think such stories will add something to our stature in the eyes of others.

Such things must not possess us. The Lord is with us—isn’t this enough? When the Lord returns, He will not ask about our unique experiences; He will ask, “Were you of the same mind with others in following Me?” Be careful about what occupies your mind, for your mind is your person.
