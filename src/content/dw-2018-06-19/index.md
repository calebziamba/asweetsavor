_Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are....That they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me._ _â€“ John 17:11, 21_

This commission of keeping the oneness is closely related to the first commission of loving one another. If we love one another as Christ has loved us, then in such a love we will be able to keep the oneness.
