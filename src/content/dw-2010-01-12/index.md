_In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. — Genesis 1:1_ In the whole universe there is only one unique God. He is the God of oneness. Genesis 1:1 begins, “In the beginning God….” This indicates that there is only one unique God. In the beginning we have God, not Gods. However, the Hebrew word for God is Elohim, a plural noun. Although a singular verb is used with this noun, the word for God is plural. In English, the Hebrew phrase would read, “We am.” How could this be? It is because in His existence, in eternity, God is not only the unique God; He is also the God of oneness.

Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that until this is understood, oneness and one accord will never be ours. There is only one God, but in Him are three hypostases—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. He is not three gods, but one unique God. When we say we love the Father, we also love the Son and the Spirit. When we say we enjoy the Spirit, we also enjoy the Father and the Son.

In the church life it is easy for us to get upset. We sometimes find ourselves in the realm of questioning who is right and who is wrong. We consider who said something right and who said something wrong, or who is ministering and who is not. But have you realized there is only one unique God? This unique One is a God of oneness.
