_You are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household._ _– Ephesians 2:19_

Because we are in the same kingdom with our fellow believers in Christ, we all share the same citizenship. All who believe in the Lord Jesus are “fellow citizens.” This shows us again that our new position is a corporate one. It is foolish to think that we can be individualistic after we are born again. In our new position, we are fellow citizens with the saints in the kingdom of God.
