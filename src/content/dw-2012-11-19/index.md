God brought David through many learning experiences. David had been a shepherd, he had been anointed, and he had proven himself by defeating Goliath and “tens of thousands” of the enemy. He had the people’s approval. Though he seemed fit to be king in men’s eyes, God knew he needed to pass through even more experiences as a fugitive in the wilderness and even in Philistia. This brought David to the point he was ready to be king.
