_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

After these religious dogs arrived, the believers became preoccupied with what they should eat and whether or not believers should be circumcised. Deception was involved. What they presented as having high value in fact took people away from what had true value.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 180.
