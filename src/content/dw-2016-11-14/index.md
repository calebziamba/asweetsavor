_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

God appeared to Abraham repeatedly throughout his life. This led him to walk the way of God and gain God Himself. God’s appearing does not produce an outwardly religious person but one who has truly encountered God.
