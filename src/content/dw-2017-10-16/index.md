_He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”_ _– Genesis 22:12_

Why did Abraham offer Isaac? The angel said, “Now I know that you fear God” (22:12). Because Abraham feared God to the uttermost, he could not but offer Isaac. Apart from his fear of God, he would never be willing to kill his own son. Because of God’s promise concerning Isaac, Abraham expected that Isaac would be raised from the dead (Heb. 11:17–19).
