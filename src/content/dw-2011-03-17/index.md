_"The king has brought me into his chambers." — Song of Songs 1:4b_

_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste. He brought me into the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love.” — Song of Songs 2:3-4_

This seeker is different from those who cannot trust in the Lord’s love. Because of the work of God, she can say, “Lord, Your banner over me is love. If I am in suffering or difficulty, it is because of Your love. Your hand of love is in everything that surrounds me. Because of Your love, You bring me through every environment so that I can live before You absolutely.”
