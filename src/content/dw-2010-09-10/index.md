_And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will. — Acts 13:22_

There is a great difference between being according to God’s heart and doing things for God. Doing things for God with no realization of God’s heart has little meaning. We should focus on what God is after. As we confront the practical realities of life, such as career and family, what is our focus? Too often, it is not the Lord. Even in our Christian service, we may do things without touching God’s heart. If we realize the importance of knowing God’s heart, our service will be healthy, and we will be blessed.
