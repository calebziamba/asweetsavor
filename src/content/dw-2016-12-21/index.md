_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you;_ _And I will make you a great nation,_ _And I will bless you,_ _And make your name great;_ _And so you shall be a blessing;_ _And I will bless those who bless you,_ _And the one who curses you I will curse._ _And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1-3_

We should all aspire to gain the Lord to the extent that we express this “great nation.” Then when people see us, they will see the heavenly authority. All the families of the earth will be blessed in us, and God’s purpose will be fulfilled.
