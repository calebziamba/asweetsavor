The book of Philippians has three positive characteristics: it is pure, focused, and joyful. Every time we come to this book we must remember these three things. First, it is pure. If we have an impure motive when we read this book, it wonâ€™t be opened to us. It is written only for those who are pure, who have no motive or desire other than Christ Himself. Second, it is focused. Each chapter of Philippians is focused on Christ. This book reminds us that Christ Himself should become the unique focus in our lives. Third, this book is joyful. It is full of rejoicing. If we are pure without any motive and focused only on Christ, we will become very joyful people.
