_“I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.” — Song of Songs 2:1_

We should keep this verse in our heart: “I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.” We may not be able to see what the future holds or how we will be able to go on. But we should have this attitude—God’s mercy and care will never fail us.

We should have a realization that we are lilies of the valleys. We should fear nothing. No matter where the Lord leads us, no matter what kind of situation we find ourselves in, we should thank the Lord. Whether it is difficult or easy, whether we like it or not, we should be thankful. We are lilies of the valleys. We live in the valleys and not in the pots. It is the Lord who cares for us and preserves us.

If we realize this, we will not become a problem in the church life. Instead, we will be able to function properly in all kinds of situations. We will simply feel, “Lord, thank You for Your leading. We are just lilies under Your care. Men don’t take care of us, nor does a work care for us. It is You Yourself who take care of each one of us. And even if we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we will fear no evil, for You are with us.”

What a deep and precious experience is found within this short chapter! The Lord’s seeker has experienced a great change here. Praise the Lord for this beautiful picture of our union with the Lord!
