_“Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, For I am sick with love.” — Song of Songs 2:5_ Raisin cakes indicate that this is a life that is broken by the cross. The process of going from vine to grape, from grape to raisin, and from raisin to cake also indicates that this is something of a mature life before the Lord.

Brothers and sisters, those who have experienced many years of the Lord’s work can render real help to us. They are the ones having raisin cakes before the Lord as the result of experiencing His work. They can help us enlarge our capacity to enjoy the Lord, and they can help us sustain our enjoyment of the Lord.”
