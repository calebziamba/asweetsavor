_But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know._ _– 1 John 2:20_

At one time you may have shared something that was so anointed and prevailing. However, when you tried to repeat the same thing in another setting, you may have found that it did not work as before. The Lord’s presence was no longer with you. In order to be approved, we must be able to teach by Christ’s anointing and not rely merely on the content.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 151.
