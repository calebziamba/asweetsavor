_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

In a good sense, to follow the Lord is easy. We don’t need to gnash our teeth and consecrate ourselves. We only need to touch His love. Spontaneously we will say, “O Lord, I have to have You as my King. My heart is Yours.” When the Lord’s love is abundant in us, this love will cause us to grow in life in the most natural way, and we will spontaneously live a life of taking Him as our King in everything.
