Whoever practices fellowship and has the reality of the life of fellowship is very inclusive. This is absolutely in opposition to religion. Religious people must decide what side someone is on before they will fellowship with them. They seek a so-called unity based on conformity in practice and terminology. Instead, we should seek after the enjoyment of the divine life in the sweetness of fellowship.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 143.
