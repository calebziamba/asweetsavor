_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

The Song of Songs is timeless. It is always fresh. After we finish its first chapter, we may think we already possess the experience revealed there. However, every time we return to read it again, we feel refreshed and more attracted than before.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 13.
