_"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away. For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. The flowers have already appeared in the land; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land. The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away!'" — Song of Songs 2:10-13_

Praise the Lord for these five points in verses 11 through 13. First, the winter is past, and the rain is over and gone. Second, flowers appear on the earth. Third, the time of singing has come. Fourth, the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. And fifth, the fig tree has ripened its figs, and the vines are in blossom.

How wonderful are these five points! The Lord repeatedly tells us, “Do not remain with what is past, for what lies ahead is even brighter and more glorious.” We have to go on persistently and labor on into the riches of Christ.

The Lord repeats, “Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come away!” (2:13). Since she now has some manifestation in life, the Lord finds her attractive. His desire is that she would go with Him and manifest His life on the earth.
