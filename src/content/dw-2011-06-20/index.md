_But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ. â€” Ephesians 2:13_ When we instruct others in Christian matters, we should not lead them into the law. We should be free to feed one another, pray and read the Bible together, and do all things in joyfulness. Yes, we do confront many problems in the church life. But instead of reacting to them by introducing regulations, we should learn not to worry about them so much. Paul tells us we have all been brought near in the blood of Christ (Eph. 2:13). Whether you think one person is better or another is worse, each one equally shares in the blood of Christ as his portion. Because of the blood of Christ, we can be one, regardless of our problems.
