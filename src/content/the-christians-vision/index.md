...I saw a vision of Christ. In this vision, I saw I’m a sinner, I need Jesus Christ. Through that, I became saved. Now after being saved, I don’t live outwardly; I live according to something inward. When I call “Oh Lord!” I’m very happy. When I read the Bible, I have the Lord’s presence. When I’m with the saints, I’m joyful. When I sing hymns, I feel I could be in the heavenlies. There’s not an outward strength; there’s just an inward desire. Just like you already ate breakfast, but for some reason, you need lunch. Needing lunch is not an outward mandate, but something you feel from the inside. For some reason, later, you need supper too! You slept last night, but for some reason, you still want to sleep tonight. This is the nature of life.
