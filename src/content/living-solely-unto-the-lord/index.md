In this, Titus Chu first brings the saints to sing several verses from a hymn, "Through the Cross, O Lord, I Pray" by Watchman Nee. This hymn speaks of our need to experience the Lord's death so that we may be fully one with him. While getting into this hymn, he challenges some of the younger brothers to spend more time to be constituted with the Word so they can be more solid in their Christian life. [The words to this hymn can be found by following this link.](http://www.witness-lee-hymns.org/hymns/H0279.html)

Brother Chu then shares on the fact that while the first 3 bulbs on the shaft of the lampstand developed branches, the 4th did not. This signifies that we should not just care for our branching out; ultimately, our life must be for God alone.

This excerpt is taken from the July 2016 Summer Vision Week training in Cleveland, OH. This training was focused on the Golden Lampstand of the Tabernacle, as described in Exodus chapter 25.
