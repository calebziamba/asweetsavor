_That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. — Philippians 3:10_

The book of Philippians possesses three notable attributes. First of all, Philippians radiates purity. Second, it can be characterized as being very focused; in it Paul does not seek to cover many different topics or to address many different issues. His one burden is that the saints would gain Christ. Third, this book expresses a particular joy. Purity speaks of someone’s being or existence; focus refers to his living; and joy has to do with what he exhibits.
