_Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. â€” John 17:17

_We have to be sanctified in the truth, and only the word of God is truth. Some of you young people, being very sharp, know this. But if I were to ask you how often you read or how much time you spend reading the Bible, what would your answer be? Possibly you do not know or are not careful in this matter. Yet, the Bible should be so much in you that you and the word become one entity.
