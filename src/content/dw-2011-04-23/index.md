Joy is the mark of having Christ. What is the mark of having Christ among the saints in your locality? Joy! If the leading brothers bring the saints into ordinances and commandments, the free flowing enjoyment of Christ disappears.

Nothing is more joyful than to be enjoying Christ with the saints in the absence of commandments and ordinances. We are free, we love Jesus, and we are in the church life! Hallelujah!
