_God’s compassion is my story,_  
_Is my boasting all the day;_  
_Mercy free and never failing_  
_Moves my will, directs my way._  
_God so loved us, God so loved us,_  
_That His only Son He gave,_  
_That His only Son He gave.  
– From a hymn tr. by Francis P. Jones  
_

When the Lord comes back, we will have to tell Him, “Lord, I marvel at Your wisdom and Your work in me. I never imagined, even in my wildest dreams, that You would lead me this way. My dream was so inferior to what You have done. You placed me in the center of Your will. You consecrated me to Yourself. You gave me all the divine riches. It was Your “mercy free and never failing” that led me, protected me, and blessed me.”

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch "Go to the listing for this book"),
