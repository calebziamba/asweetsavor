_Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac._ _– Genesis 25:5_

Just as Isaac lived in Canaan and enjoyed all his father’s riches that he would inherit, today we enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ in the Spirit. The pledge of the Spirit which we enjoy today is a foretaste of what we will enjoy in full as our inheritance in eternity.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 128-129.
