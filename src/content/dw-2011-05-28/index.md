_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_ Now we come to the final stage of our growth in life as portrayed in the Psalms of Ascent. Psalm 132 portrays our exercise in maturity for the sake of the Lord’s testimony. Psalms 133 and 134 are the manifestation and display of the church life in maturity. We will see that eventually our maturity is no longer an individual experience, but a corporate one.
