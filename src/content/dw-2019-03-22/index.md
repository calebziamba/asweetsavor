_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._ _– Philippians 1:1_

_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_  
  
We must learn to say, “I am not for my father, and he is not for me. We are both for the Lord.” (1 Cor. 3:21–23).

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")
