_Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose._ _—Philippians 2:2_

In this verse, the phrase “united in spirit” is a translation of the Greek word _súmpsuchos_, which has also been translated “joined in soul” (Darby) and “of one accord” (NKJV). Paul tied this with “being of the same mind” and being “intent on one purpose.” To Paul, being of one accord is very much related to the mind, for our mind determines who we are.
