_He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. — Colossians 1:15-17_ The unique substance for the saints’ living in the Body life is Christ, the Son of the Father’s love. As the image of the invisible God (1:15a), the Firstborn of all creation (1:15b), the One who is before all things (1:17a), and the One in whom all things cohere (1:17b), Christ is the preeminent One in creation. As the image of the invisible God, He is the expression of God even in the visible creation. He is the One through whom all things were made, and He is the Firstborn of all things. If you appreciate a flower or a bird, you have to realize that the Firstborn is Christ.

Eventually we should realize that anything without Christ is devoid of value. If there is any value in the universe, it owes itself to Christ. All creation is in Christ, through Christ, and eventually unto Christ.
