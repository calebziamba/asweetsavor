_That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._ _â€“ Ephesians 1:18_

The new position we have received is truly marvelous. We should pay far more attention to our new position than we do to our problems, failures, and limitations. In fact, if we truly understood our position, we would forget about all the negative things of our situation.
