_Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up._ _– John 2:19_

_Because we are members of His body._ _– Ephesians 5:30_

The building up of the body cannot be carried out by our human effort. It is not a matter of saying to each other, “I want to be built up with you.” Although it may be good to say this, if we really want to be built up together we should simply enjoy the person of Christ. He is the Builder of His body, and the more we enjoy Him as a living person in our spirit, the more we will be built up into the body of Christ.
