_For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me. — Philippians 1:6-7_

Eventually, we can see that such a church as the church in Philippi surely became the apostle’s boast. I doubt that Paul could speak of the saints in Corinth with the same kind of joy. Perhaps their situation might prompt him to sigh “O Lord,” whereas when he considered the saints in Philippi he would burst out, “Praise the Lord!” Why is this? This is because the saints in Philippi were one with Paul in his struggle for the advancement of the gospel.

I believe even Brother Lee had such an experience among the churches here in the Great Lakes area. Every time there was a crisis in the Lord’s recovery, there was a particular church to which he could go to restore his ministry among the churches. We should all desire to be such a church with such a church life that can afford the apostle the ground to operate freely to carry out the ministry the Lord has committed to him for His Body’s sake.

When the servant of the Lord sees such a church, he knows he has not run in vain nor labored in vain. Paul was willing to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and priestly service of the Philippian saints’ faith (2:17-18). The apostle and the church in Philippi were rejoicing together, and in such a situation, the apostle was joyful that he had such a church to be poured out upon. In other words, he was willing even to die for them to produce such a mutual satisfaction in Christ.
