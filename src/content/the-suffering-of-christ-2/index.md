> _Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._
> 
> \- Philippians 2:5-7

We have no way to conceive of all He gave up to become our Savior, yet He came. In fact, He was prepared to come from the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:20; Rev. 13:8). It was in His heart. He was willing to give up His rights.
