_I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep._ _– John 10:11_

_He who has the bride is the bridegroom._ _– John 3:29a_

The more we fellowship over our enjoyment of Christ in so many aspects, the more our spirits will be stirred up. Our Christ is so lovely, so enjoyable, and so real! He is our Lamb, our Friend, our older Brother, our Shepherd, our Builder, and our Bridegroom! When we enjoy Him in this way, we realize that we have no more problems and no more difficulties.

We don’t have to make any effort to do anything, for we were not born again so that we would have to struggle so hard. Rather, we were born again into a living of enjoyment, a living in which we daily enjoy Christ as everything to us. We worship the Lord for this. May we all tell the Lord how much we love Him and enjoy Him!
