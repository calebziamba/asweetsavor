_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men._ _— Philippians 2:5–7_

In Philippians 2:5–11, Paul presented a profound view of the experience of Christ for the sake of accomplishing God’s eternal plan. No other verses in the entire Bible portray this matter so clearly. In this portion, Paul carefully chose every word as he unveiled the mystery of Christ’s incarnation and crucifixion.
