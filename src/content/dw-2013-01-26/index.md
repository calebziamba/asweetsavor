_“Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:8_

When we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, telling Him, “I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense,” He will surely be moved to reveal these things to us: that we live in the heavenly places; that the truth can become our reality; that we must put on the church to have a life of spiritual warfare; and that we live in the victory of the cross.

Here the Lord is saying, “If you are willing to live in the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense, you need to experience the reality of ascension. You have to live a life of ascension and experience the transcendence of ascension. The truth, the church, and the victory of the cross can then be substantiated in you.”
