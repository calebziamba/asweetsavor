_I wait for the Lord; my soul waits, and in His word I hope — Psalm 130:5_

Because we see who we are we learn to wait on the Lord (Psalm 130:5). We used to be so confident in our ability to serve the Lord. Now we realize, “I am a hopeless, useless person. There is no way for me to build up the church, to help the saints, or to please the Lord. All I can do is wait for His mercy.”

Even though we know we are so terrible, we cannot go back to the world or try to escape the church life. All we can do is wait on the Lord. Not only do we wait, but we hope in the Lord’s word. We realize that His word can nourish us, sustain us and lead us. When we are so aware of our poor condition because of the Lord’s shining, we should hope in His word. The Lord’s word can re-establish us in life.
