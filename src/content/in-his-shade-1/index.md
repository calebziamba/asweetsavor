> In his shade I took great delight and sat down,  
> And his fruit was sweet to my taste
> 
> \- Song of Songs 2:3

Here the seeker speaks of her delight in the shade of her beloved, whom she likens to this most lovely fruit tree, and of how she sat down in his shade. His life has become her covering. When we come to experience the Lord in this way, we sit down in His shade, and His life covers us, becoming our strength and even our delight.
