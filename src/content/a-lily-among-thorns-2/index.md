> “Like a lily among the thorns,  
> So is my darling among the maidens.”
> 
> \- Song of Songs 2:2

Many things stab at you and seek your hurt, and many things give rise to tears and cause you to feel you cannot walk any further. However, you don’t have to be afraid; these environments will cause you to grow. The Lord watches over the lilies and protects them. If you give yourself to the Lord and truly love Him you will still encounter the thorns, but they will only help you to grow in life.
