_After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ attendant,  saying: “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.” — Joshua 1:1-3_ What was physically true for the children of Israel is spiritually true for us today. Israel shrunk back from taking the good land for fear of the giants in the land. We shrink back also, not realizing how much the Lord could use us. If we would walk as pioneers with an aggressive attitude to take the land, then Christ’s unsearchable riches will be our reality, and we will become His inheritance with glory. It is all according to how far we want to go.
