_"That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You.” — John 17:21_

This refers to a mutual living. Although we may have the same life, what about having the same living? It is easy for one in the church life to live like an ancient Confucius, while at the same time another one lives like a modern-day hippie. So our living is in trouble. We may try to conform another saint to our own preference by insisting that our way is proper and the other way is not, but this is not the secret of oneness. The secret must not be an American type, an ancient Confucius type, a yuppie type, a hippie type, etc. The secret can only be one thing: “That they may be one even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You.”
