_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _— Philippians 1:2_

When we enjoy Christ as grace, something becomes established inwardly, and we find that we are able to stand with the Lord. This brings about an inward peace. In other words, when we experience the Lord meeting our need and becoming our enjoyment in grace, we can cooperate with Him by taking a stand. At such a time, we experience peace inwardly.

Many have experienced the peace that comes when we take a firm stand to be one with the Lord’s leading in some matter in our lives. As soon as we take this stand with the Lord, we experience peace.
