> God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”
> 
> – Exodus 3:14, NASB

> Jesus Christ _is_ the same yesterday and today and forever.
> 
> \- Hebrews 13:8, NASB

We have a hymn which says, “Yesterday, today, to eternity, Jesus is the same. All may change but Jesus never.” It’s a beautiful hymn, but still, if you go deeper, it is not just that He never changes, but even His existence is self-existent. Nobody created Him; He’s just there. You might say, “How could that be?” That’s why He’s God and why you are a man. He’s God. That’s why He’s self-existing and ever-existing. He is self-existing all the way. He is the same-existing, self-existing, ever-existing, triune God Himself.
