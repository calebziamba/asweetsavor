_That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit._ _– John 3:6_

_God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth._ _– John 4:24_

From these verses we see that, in our new living after being born again, we need to enjoy Christ as a living person, and this enjoyment takes place in our human spirit.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 73.
