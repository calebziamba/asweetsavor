_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

The material world diverts Christians from following the Lord. Do not think that the world only uses sinful things to draw people away. When a high-paying, prestigious, and rewarding career presents itself, many Christians compromise their stand, turn from following Christ, and live a vain and empty life.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 127.
