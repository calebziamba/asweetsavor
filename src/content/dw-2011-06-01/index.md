_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_ This is why Psalm 132 is so crucial in our experience. It shows us a mature saint who has grown by the Lord’s transforming hand. He has become one with the Lord. He no longer thinks, “How can I bless other saints? How can I be used by the Lord? How can I be a blessing to the church?” Now he is in a different realm. He can tell the Lord, “I don’t know whether I’m a blessing or not. I don’t care whether I’m used by You or not. These things no longer matter to me. But Lord, I am still so desperate! I ask You, where is the reality? Where is the substance of all the things we have talked about?”
