_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

When the Lord calls us to go with Him, no one is clear enough to respond immediately. Consider the situation of the seeking one here. She has had many precious experiences. She has been experiencing the enjoyment of the banqueting house with all the saints. The Lord’s banner of love is spread over her. Her testimony is that she is dwelling in the loving arms of the Lord.

She also tells the saints, “You are my enjoyment, my raisin cakes, and my apples. It is so enjoyable to be with the Lord and with you all. We have had some wonderful building up and fellowship. We never quarrel or argue. We are in one accord and have become one another’s supply.”

When at such a moment the Lord appears and says, “Arise,” the seeking one is puzzled and asks, “Lord, do You really want me to go? Where do You want me to go to?” In fact we may not even be as spiritual as this, and perhaps would not even be able to see or hear the calling of the Lord while in such a state.
