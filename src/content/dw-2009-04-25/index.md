_Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the house faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right side of the house, from south of the altar...._ _— Ezekiel 47:1_ _Then he said to me, "These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah; then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters of the sea become fresh.” — Ezekiel 47:8_

So what does the church in your place need? It needs a river. Don't look at the situation of the people in your city. If you do this, you will become discouraged. Don't be too concerned about the situation around you, regardless of how discouraging it seems. Instead, pray for the flow.

Look unto the Lord that the stream would come. Don't make issues among yourselves. Instead, take the cross in the church life and endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. As you do this, there will be a flow, regardless of your number. And if you allow the Lord to measure you until that flow becomes a mighty river, then even the dead sea will be healed and turn sweet. Those you contact will be softened. They will be attracted, and they will be willing to receive from you. Even if they are the dead sea, the riches of Christ will reach them.
