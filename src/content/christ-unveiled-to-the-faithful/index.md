> there were _some_ shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock at night... And _so_ the angel said to them, ... "today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."

All of a sudden, _Christ_ was unveiled. Unveiled to whom? Not to those in the temple, nor to those reading scripture all the time. Not to scribes, not to the pharisees, nor to the priests, but unveiled, rather, to a group of shepherds who only knew three things: "I have a flock, I will tend them whether day or night, and I will tend them even in the wilderness. I will tend them because I'd like to be faithful to whatever I'm committed with." This virtue is a virtue even for the children of God today. God enjoys unveiling Christ to such ones, to those who can say, "I still want to serve, even in the night. I still want to serve, even in the wilderness. I want to be faithful to the flock I have."
