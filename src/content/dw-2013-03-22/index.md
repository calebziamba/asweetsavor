_“Now behold, with great pains I have prepared for the house of the Lord 100,000 talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for they are in great quantity; also timber and stone I have prepared, and you may add to them.” – First Chronicles 22:14_

Iron and brass signify God’s ruling and judgment. In Revelation, the Lord rules with a rod of iron and stands on feet of brass (19:15; 1:15). As He rules and judges us, iron and brass are produced in us for God’s building. Under God’s government, we are being judged, disciplined, and regulated. One day the deposit of iron and brass in us will qualify us to reign with Christ for one thousand years (Rev. 20:6).
