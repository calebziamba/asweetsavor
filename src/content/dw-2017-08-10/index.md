_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

God appeared to Abraham at least seven times. Each time He appeared, the vision became higher and richer in the unveiling of God’s desire. Each additional vision built upon the foundation of the initial vision. We will not get a second vision to replace the first or a third to replace the second.
