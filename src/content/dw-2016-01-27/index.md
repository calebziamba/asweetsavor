_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... â€”Philippians 2:1_

For a healthy church life, there is much need of encouragement in Christ and consolation of love. We cannot console others, however, unless we value them above our own views and practices. Otherwise we are struggling to win others over to our preferences instead of seeking what is best for them in Christ.
