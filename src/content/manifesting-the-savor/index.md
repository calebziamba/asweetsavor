> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 2:14-16, KJV

There are some spiritual practices that, through these practices, produce the savor. Now, there are four practices. Let me tell you brothers, please, all through your life treasure these four practices. I have treasured this for years and still treasure this. First that you need to be covered with the Lord's presence. And second you need to experience Christ subjectively on all practical matters. And third, we need to attach ourselves to some brothers or sisters. Sisters attached to sisters, brothers attached to brothers. And fourth, we need to live for those who are with us in our locality. Even short of any one of them - you just practice three items or you just practice two items - you will never experience the triumph in the Christ, and you will never be the sweet savor in Christ and to God. This savor comes out from the daily practice of the four things.
