_“What will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”_ _– Genesis 15:2._

According to Abraham’s natural concept, since he was childless, his steward would have to be his heir. When we first begin to follow the Lord, we do so according to our natural concept. is very natural to begin mimicking the behavior of the believers around us. We watch how they speak for the Lord and do the same. We listen to how they pray and do our best to imitate them. This kind of mimicry fits our natural concept. It is what Eliezer represents.
