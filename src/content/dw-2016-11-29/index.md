_Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Immediately they left their nets and followed Him._ _– Matthew 4:19–20_

When the Lord appears to us, we see something of Him, causing us to realize how wonderful He is. This is followed by His call—His speaking within concerning His heart’s desire, which guides us in our Christian walk. We are held by this call. It will not allow us to leave the Lord, no matter what difficulties we encounter. Though we may temporarily be swayed by others’ opposition or persuasion, when we return to the Lord and enjoy Him, His word comes back to us unchanged.
