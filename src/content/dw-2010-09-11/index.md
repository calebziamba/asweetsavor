_And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will. — Acts 13:22_ We all need to consider why we do what we do. For instance, if you are a student, why did you choose the college you attend? You may respond, “I want to have a good career.” Why? “So I can get married and raise a family.” Again, why? So you can have grandchildren? What is your goal? Even in smaller matters we should ask ourselves this question. Suppose you like to buy spiritual books. Ask yourself why. You may answer, “I am trying to acquire a good library.” Why? Perhaps you would eventually admit, “I want to be respected as a spiritual brother.” Dare we ask why one more time? Many faithful, zealous Christians live out their entire lives without ever answering the question, “Why am I doing this?” The Lord today is hard-pressed to find anyone who cares about what is on His heart. We may live our lives piously, admirably, and even faithfully, but unless our goal is the Lord’s profit, He will not find His satisfaction in us.

A proper relationship with God involves our person. The right kind of person is one according to God’s heart. Once our person is right before God, we can properly serve our generation. This sounds simple, but it is difficult to live out.
