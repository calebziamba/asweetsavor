_The plowers plowed upon my back; They made their furrows long. — Psalm 129:3_

When we serve the Lord, it is good if people can look at us and see furrows. This means that we don’t impress people with our talent or ability. Instead people say, “There is something different about this person. He has the mark of the Lord’s workmanship. He is a man of God.”

It is the plowing and cutting of deep and long furrows that give us the healthy growth in life. We all should be those who are thoroughly marked with the Lord’s disciplinary workmanship. Then people will not get the impression that we are talented. Instead they will recognize something of life. They will recognize that we are people of God, because the Lord has plowed us time and time again for life to grow.
