_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _â€” Romans 1:1-3_

Christ Himself must be our lifelong choice. God desires nothing outside of Christ. He wants only Christ, to give us only Christ, and for us to enjoy, experience, and gain only Christ over the course of our whole life. He desires our existence to be for Christ alone and wants us to pursue and live out only Christ Himself. Other than Christ, nothing should occupy or possess us. Christ alone must be our vision, desire, and center, so that we would be completely gained by Him.
