_Until the cool of the day When the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense. — Song of Songs 4:6_

Now she has a feeling that as one the Lord has praised, and as one manifested in the church, she needs to go to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense to dwell there. She longs that the myrrh, the death of Christ, would perfume her, so that she could express His resurrection, represented by the frankincense.

Although she was not always obedient when the cross was working on her, she eventually became full of the riches of life. Now, she is willing to rise up and walk with the Lord.
