The co-workers should have a mind to suffer. If the Lord provides, you can still have a good living. If the Lord doesn’t provide, however, you shouldn’t insist on a good living and get into debt in order to own a nice house and a good car. This kind of person does not qualify to be a servant of the Lord. You have the right to drive a good car. You have the right to live in a good house. You also have the right to drink good tea. However, you should care about the conscience of the saints. Otherwise, you cannot be useful before the Lord. This is not only a matter of character or disposition, but also a matter of personality.
