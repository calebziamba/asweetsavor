Often the more we try to defend something, the more we open the door to further accusation. It is not a small thing to be able to respond as Hannah did. If we are able to respond so sweetly, it will open the door to a sweet church life where everyone is for the Lord and loves Him. Others don’t have the intention of doing anything damaging. They just see things differently. In the church life, let us all find favor in one another’s sight.
