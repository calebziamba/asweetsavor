In first John 1:1, the apostle John tells us of his own experience of growing in Christ, and in so doing asks the question: How real is your Christ to you? Have you heard Him? Seen Him? Looked upon Him? Handled Him? In this excerpt, brother Titus expounds on the difference between seeing Jesus and looking upon Jesus.
