_“This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.”_ _– John 15:12_

What are the Lord’s three commissions to us, as seen in the Gospel of John? First, we should love one another and give ourselves to one another. Second, we should keep the oneness and not care for doctrines and practices. And third, we should feed and shepherd someone. We all have to learn how to feed and shepherd our fellow believers.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 101.
