_But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually. â€” First Corinthians 2:14_ You must equip yourself to be on guard against seeing things according to right or wrong. Instead, you must see things spiritually. It is a pity that so many who serve the Lord have never equipped themselves in this way. Although many have extensively read spiritual writings, their spiritual understanding is still weak, as is their ability to react to things spiritually. Needless to say, such saints are not spiritually keen. These saints, when they serve the church, do so in a principled manner, but they are often unclear about the real condition of the saints. Thus, they may lead the saints into contentiousness or controversy without any consciousness of what they are doing.
