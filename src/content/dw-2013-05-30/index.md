Some don’t know what purity is, for their personalities are impure. Even when they are praying with tears, they are not pure. In their entire person, nothing of purity can be found.

Some cannot be focused. They know nothing about focusing. Even when they are concentrating, they are still thinking about something else. A person cannot accomplish anything if he is not focused. The Lord cannot use this kind of personality.

Some have received the riches from the Lord, but they supply others with “polluted” riches. If they meet a person who likes sweets, they will add sugar to their words.

Some are infatuated with work and full of ambition, so that the food they supply is poisonous.
