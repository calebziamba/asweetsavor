Through his experience, Joshua learned many lessons. First, he encountered and defeated Amalek, which became a continual reminder to him to be watchful. Second, he witnessed Jethro’s attempt to help Moses, and third, he witnessed God’s response that they have no other gods. Fourth, he saw how God desired that they hold feasts unto Him, representing the enjoyment of Christ. Fifth, he was with Moses when God unveiled the pattern of the tabernacle and the priesthood for His testimony. Sixth, he learned patience by remaining at the tent of meeting. Are you ready to learn such lessons? If you are, then the Lord will be faithful to train you and use you as He did Joshua.
