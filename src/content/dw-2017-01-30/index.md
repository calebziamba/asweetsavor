_That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints._ _– Ephesians 1:18_

We have to realize that so many wonderful things happened to us the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ! Formerly we were in a poor and hopeless position, but by being born again we migrated from one “country” to another. We have been transferred into an entirely new position. Now we can enjoy all of the different items that God has provided for us as a result of our being born again.
