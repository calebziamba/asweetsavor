_“May it be that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink,’ and who answers, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels also’—may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac.”_ _– Genesis 24:14_

Amazingly enough, Rebekah came, gave water to Abraham's servant, and then drew water for the camels. As he drank, he gazed at her to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not. In the same way, the Spirit found us. He came and called us, which led to our being gained.
