_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_ _– John 1:29_

We should learn to worship the Lord as the Lamb of God, our Redeemer, in this way:

_Praise the Lord, I have the Lamb of God! This Lamb takes away all my sins, not only in the past, not only today, but even in the future. All my sins have been dealt with. The more I enjoy Christ, the more I feel sinless. The more I enjoy Christ, the more I’m released from the burden of sin. The more I enjoy Christ, the more I’m set apart from the world. All the negative things in the universe are taken away by my enjoyment of the Lamb of God. This is wonderful! Hallelujah!_
