_“__Behold, I am with you and will keep you  
wherever you go, and will bring you back  
to this land; for I will not leave you until  
I have done what I have promised you”  
– Genesis 32:28  
_

When we follow the Lord, we all are Jacobs. We may afflict others through our scheming to such an extent that they become angry with us. Yet God preserves us. None of us can be confident of loving God, remaining strong, and standing firm to the end. The only assurance we have of following the Lord faithfully is God’s preserving power. We may scheme, plan, and hope, but eventually it is only God’s hand that preserves. Though He works in our environment, allowing us to go through hardship, difficulties, and affliction, His hand preserves us and keeps us safe. Praise Him!
