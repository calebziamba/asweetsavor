_A Song of Ascents, of David._

_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron's beard, Coming down upon the edge of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon That descended upon the mountains of Zion; For there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore. — Psalm 133:1-3_

This is a psalm we all know very well because we often sing it as a hymn. However, we may not truly know this psalm as it was meant to be known.

Psalm 133 was meant to be a display of maturity, not a display of emotion. But we often enjoy this psalm in a very emotional way. We sing, “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!” Then after singing it so joyfully in a meeting we may think that we are one. We need to realize that this is not an emotional psalm. Rather, it is a display of the maturity that results from all the previous experiences in the Psalms of Ascent.
