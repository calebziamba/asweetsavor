Do not take this matter of spiritual reactions lightly, nor think it is something shallow. All the problems in the church life stem from the saints' inability to react to things spiritually. This is why the churches are frustrated from being built up.

One brother gave this testimony: “This morning I hurriedly got ready so that I might arrive on time for the meeting. My wife, however, argued with me, and my son refused to get out of bed. And when I finally arrived, the meeting was cold and dead.” This kind of testimony indicates a lack of spiritual understanding. When his wife argues with him, this brother should realize that the Lord is in that, and when his son refuses to get up, he should feel, “Lord, this is something from You.”

Then how should this brother react spiritually to this situation once he has this kind of spiritual understanding? Perhaps he would feel to rise up earlier and prepare breakfast for his wife, and then invite her to join him, and then go together to the meeting. You must eventually learn such lessons if you wish to serve in the church life. Develop this ability to spiritually understand and react to all situations.
