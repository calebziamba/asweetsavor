_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

We cannot lose sight of this principle. To be a seed means that we are full of life. We must be in life.

Practically speaking, this means that if we want to be a seed, we must learn how to sing a song to the Lord; we must learn how to call upon His name; we must learn how to touch Him and abide in His presence; we must learn how to stay in the anointing, and let the anointing supply, nourish, encourage, regulate, and strengthen us.
