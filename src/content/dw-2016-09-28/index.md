_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

Many feel they deserve more than they have received, so they are not satisfied. When they see an opening to improve their lot, they try to grasp it. This is not according to the mind of Christ but of Satan, who as Lucifer initiated this kind of grasping in the universe.
