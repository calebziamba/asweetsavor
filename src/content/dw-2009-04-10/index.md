_Draw me; we will run after you. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will rejoice in you and be glad; We will extol your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you. — The Song of Songs 1:4_ Finally, verse 4 says, “Rightly do they love you.” What identifies a virgin is that he loves the Lord rightly, meaning his love is without any other wish, expectation, or condition. A true virgin thus follows the Lord without any condition, serves without any condition, and lives unconditionally in fellowship with the Lord. To such a one, joy cannot replace the Lord Himself—even the Lord's presence cannot replace the Lord Himself. Such a person is so obedient to love the Lord that he has no request for anything. Besides the Lord, he desires nothing else and loves nothing else.

If the saints in a church are interested in the Lord and the enjoyment of the Lord alone, it shows that they rightly love the Lord. Some people do not love the Lord rightly. There are many conditions in their love. When a church is short of virgins, there will be a lot of conditions before the saints will submit to Him or give themselves. The church needs so many who rightly love the Lord. The more people there are who loving the Lord in this way, the more life and freshness there will be in the church.
