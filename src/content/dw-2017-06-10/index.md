_The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”_ _– John 1:29_

How do we enjoy Christ as the Lamb of God? We enjoy Him by realizing that He has taken away all our sins through His death on the cross. Our sins are not merely forgiven and covered, but taken away. This is true not only of the sins we committed yesterday, but even of the sins that we will commit twenty years from now. All our sins, past, present, and future, have already been taken away by the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, by Titus Chu; page 74.
