> \[The Lord Jesus Christ\] will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.
> 
> \- Philippians 3:21

The Christian life is a renewing life. How much we are renewed decides how much spiritual reality we have. Sanctification is the inward result of renewing. Transformation is the outward display of renewing. The degree to which we are renewed, sanctified, and transformed is the degree to which we are conformed. Conformation is not something in the futureâ€” it is a prize we possess today.
