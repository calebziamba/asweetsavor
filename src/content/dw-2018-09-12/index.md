_When they did not find them, they began dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have upset the world have come here also; and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.”_ _– Acts 17:6-7_

If we want approvedness, we must first be sincere and desperate, driven by our burden. It is very easy to take spiritual things for granted and handle them in a common way. We may love the Lord; we may be respectable and faithful in our serving life; we may be rich in truth and experience. However, if we are not desperate and burdened, we will not possess approvedness.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 138-139.
