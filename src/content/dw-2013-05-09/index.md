_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ._ _– Philippians 3:8_

Philippians reminds us that as Christians our life should have these three characteristics. Our life should be so pure: “Lord, I love You, and You alone.” Then we should be focused, single in goal and purpose: “I give myself to You, Lord. I am not aiming at so many things. I am aiming only at You.” Then we will be so joyful, and those around us will be affected. Our lives should be pure, focused, and joyful. This is how Philippians was written, and this is how we as Christians should live.
