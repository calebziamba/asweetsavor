_“The Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys.”_ _– Genesis 24:35_

The Holy Spirit never testifies for Himself. In the same way, we should not testify for ourselves. It would not have helped for the servant to say, “I am Abraham’s steward. Without me, Abraham cannot handle his properties.” Likewise, there is nothing attractive about our boasting of our Christian work. The Holy Spirit only testifies of the Father and the Son and attracts us to follow the Lord. Our testimony should be the same.
