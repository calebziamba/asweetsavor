_There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish,...And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than Saul. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people. — First Samuel 9:1-2_ The man chosen from among the Israelites to be their king was Saul, a good man of a choice family. He must have appeared to be the right choice.

Samuel anointed Saul king. He “took a flask of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said: Is it not because the Lord has anointed you commander over His inheritance?” (10:1). Samuel did not make such a speech when he anointed David. I believe Samuel really liked Saul. Thus Saul was anointed to be the first king over God’s inheritance, the nation of Israel. And as Saul, the new king, turned to leave and go forth, God gave him a new heart (v. 9). What a confirmation! He became another person, no longer fearful. Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon him so that he spoke among the prophets (v. 10).
