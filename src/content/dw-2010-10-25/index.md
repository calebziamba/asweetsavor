_O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; Nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me._ _Surely I have weaned and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child rests against his mother, My soul is like a weaned child within me. O Israel, hope in Jehovah From this time forth and forever. â€” Psalm 131:1-3_
