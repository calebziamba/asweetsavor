_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

While Exodus is famous for its complaints, the book of Job is famous for its disputes. Satan was allowed to do many cruel things to Job. Eventually, after having lost everything, including his children, Job was reduced to scraping his flesh with shards of pottery to relieve his itching boils (Job 2:7–8). Even his wife added to his suffering, suggesting that he curse God and die (2:9). Then three of his friends came to reason with him, and Elihu, a comparatively young man, had some things to say that seemed reasonable.
