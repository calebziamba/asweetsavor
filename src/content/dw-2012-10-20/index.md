_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

If the element of life, our experience of the Lord’s life within us, is weak, then nothing works. To serve the Lord effectively we must be a healthy seed that is full of life. Then when the seed is buried life will operate in a greater way, and with a greater capacity.
