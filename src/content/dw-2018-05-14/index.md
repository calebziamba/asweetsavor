_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

Paul’s fourteen epistles, from Romans through Hebrews, are centered on Jesus Christ. The purpose and burden behind all of his epistles is to reveal Christ to us, to supply Christ to us, and to help us experience and enjoy Christ.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 6.
