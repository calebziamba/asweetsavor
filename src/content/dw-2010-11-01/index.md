_O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; Nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me — Psalm 131:1_

_I would not have the restless will that hurries to and fro, Seeking for some great thing to do or secret thing to know; I would be treated as a child, and guided where I go. — Anna Laetitia Waring_ There is a song written by a Quaker sister named Anna Laetitia Waring. One verse in particular fully corresponds to Psalm 131. It says, “I would not have the restless will that hurries to and fro, seeking for some great thing to do or secret thing to know; I would be treated as a child, and guided where I go.”

We often have a “restless will that hurries to and fro.” In other words, our natural tendency is to go wherever the “action” is. If the place of action changes then we rush off in that direction. Furthermore, we are often “seeking for some great thing to do or secret thing to know.” All of us would like to accomplish at least a few great things for the Lord. We all wish that we could go out on the street and preach the gospel and have hundreds of people get saved and baptized. We seek after “great things.”
