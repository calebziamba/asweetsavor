"_Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever." – First Chronicles 22:9-10_

In these verses, Solomon typifies Christ, “the Son of David” (Matt. 1:1), who truly knows God as His Father and whose throne is “forever and ever” (Heb. 1:8).

David had a double blessing from God. On earth, he had Solomon as a son, who would rule Israel and build the temple. From the heavens, Christ would come as “the seed of David” (Rom. 1:3) when He became a man, and would establish a heavenly kingdom (John 18:36). Therefore, David is related to both an earthly kingdom and a heavenly one.
