_“Thy name is as ointment poured forth.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:3, KJV_

The book of Philippians tells us,

_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name._  
_– Philippians 2:8–9_

These verses show us that “your name” in 1:3 actually refers to the Lord’s work. As a result of His work, He has the name that is above every name. Hence, His name refers to His work.
