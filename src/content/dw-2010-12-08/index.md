_“While the king was at his table, my spikenard gave forth its fragrance." — Song of Songs 1:12_

What does the king enjoy while he is at his table? The enjoyment is Christ and the food is also Christ. Only Christ can satisfy God. On one hand, it seems we are not important when we recognize that the king is at his table. However, we are not told what food was set upon the king’s table. Rather, we are told that while he was at the table, “My spikenard gave forth its fragrance.” What Christ has accomplished is not the center here. Instead, we are the center of Christ’s work before God. Although it is the Lord who is at the table, we are there too as the result of His work. This phrase, “My spikenard gave forth its fragrance,” should fill us with joy. Earlier the Shulammite said, “Your name is like ointment.” Now she says, “While the king was at his table, my spikenard gave forth its fragrance.” What a wonderful experience this is!

The phrase “your name is like ointment” (1:3b),  indicates that our Lord is not only rich but also processed; He became a man, suffered, shed blood, was crucified, passed through death, and was resurrected. He went to the cross and died for us. His work gives forth a fragrance, so that we can say, “Your name is like ointment.” Now, however, the Shulammite can say, _my_ spikenard gave forth its fragrance for the king’s satisfaction.
