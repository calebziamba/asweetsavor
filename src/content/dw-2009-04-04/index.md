_Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. —Ruth 2:1_ Boaz was a man of rich supply. He was related to “God Is My King” (Elimelech), but his own name means “in him is strength” (see 1 Kings 7:21, where Boaz was one of the two pillars that upheld the temple of the Lord). Boaz was very rich and able to meet any need a person might have.

Perhaps we feel that we are too weak to partake of all the riches of Christ, who is our Boaz. When we come to God's house, however, we find that this One even has the ability to supply us with what is needed to partake of His riches. He can supply us whether we are strong or weak. Whatever we need, He is. Our Lord's unsearchable riches become our supply. Regardless of our state, in Him is strength. Even if we are spiritually sick and too weak to eat, we have a Boaz who can take care of us, for in Him is strength. He is so unsearchably rich.
