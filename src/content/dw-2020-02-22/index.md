_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

In order to enter into complete oneness with Christ, the Philippians had to overcome the distraction of religion, which was promoted by these evil workers. They had to realize that although these workers seemed to be good, they actually were doing an evil work, damaging others.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 181.
