The Gospel of John reveals that, as those who have been born again, Christ has given us three commissions. As we consider these commissions, we can see that since we are in the body of Christ, we should not focus only on ourselves, but also care for others. However, we should not view this as a heavy requirement. Rather, we should consider it as the sum of our enjoyment of all the riches of Christ that we have covered previously.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 98-99.
