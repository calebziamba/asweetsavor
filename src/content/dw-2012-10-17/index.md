_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

When a person first gets saved he may have no understanding of what life is. He doesn’t know how life operates. He doesn’t know how great or how powerful this life is. He doesn’t know how sufficient, rich, and fine this life is. He has no idea how glorious it will be when this life is manifested. Still, he is simply filled with life.
