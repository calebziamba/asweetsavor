"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." — John 12:24_

_He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets._ _— Matthew 12:19_

For us to follow the Lord we must be the same as He was, which means that we do not strive nor cry out so that we could be manifested. We must be able to say, “My Lord is the Lord Jesus. I know whom I have believed. I know whom I have trusted. I don’t need to strive. I don’t need to cry out. I don’t need to make any noise. With my life there is nothing fair, and there is nothing unfair. I am just a seed to be buried.”
