_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

To serve the Lord, we must give up our freedom and become His bond-servants, His slaves. This is the hardest thing for us to do. It is easy to think, “I want to serve the Lord. I want to give conferences and speak in front of thousands of people. I want to be known and admired.” Such thoughts are obviously impure. Paul didn’t serve the Lord for his own enjoyment or ambition. Nor did he serve the Lord so that other Christians could enjoy his messages. He served as a slave who did not have any freedom. He served the Lord because he had no choice (1 Cor. 9:16).
