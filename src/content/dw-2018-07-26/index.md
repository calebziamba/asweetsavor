_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Our lives as Christians are not only concerned with redemption but also with the inward growth of God’s life through salvation. The life of God needs to continually grow in us until we are completely sanctified and transformed inwardly, and we are glorified with Christ.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 14.
