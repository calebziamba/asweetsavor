_For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad._ _— Second Corinthians 5:10_

I know a servant of the Lord who spoke a word of truth at a Christian conference and afterward was severely criticized and even asked to step down. I feel the Lord will reward him for the faithful stand he took in speaking the truth.

We may not feel that we have accomplished much, but the Lord may use what we have done beyond our expectation. Perhaps in one instance you spoke just a few minutes, but because of what you spoke, many might be saved throughout the globe.
