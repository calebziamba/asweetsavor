_“He brought me to the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love. Sustain me with cakes of raisins, Refresh me with apples, For I am lovesick. His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me.” — Song of Songs 2:4-6_

Although this union has not reached its highest point, she indeed feels, “Oh, Lord, You are my banner now. I rest in You. I am secure in You. Now my eyes are upon You. No environment can affect me. I am restful in You. I can see You face to face. I can gaze on You and enjoy You.”
