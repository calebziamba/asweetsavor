_Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves. Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others._ _— Philippians 2:3-4_

_I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth._ _— First Corinthians 3:6_

The more we are able to regard others as more important than ourselves, the more we will be able to “look out…for the interests of others” (Phil. 2:4), or as Darby’s New Translation reads, “regarding not each his own qualities, but each those of others also.” We no longer consider only what we are able to do, but now we also begin to appreciate what others are able to do.
