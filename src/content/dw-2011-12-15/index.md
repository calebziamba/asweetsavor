_\[Saul\] proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah. He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" — First Samuel 19:23-24_

Finally, Saul chose to go himself. David must have been trembling, for he had no army. When Saul arrived, probably with a number of his officers, he too experienced what the others had, but even more so, for not only did he prophesy, he even stripped naked and lay on the ground, prophesying for an entire day and night (1 Sam. 19:23–24).

Although God delivered David in such a miraculous way, David had not yet fully learned to trust God for his protection. He might have looked over at Samuel and asked, “Why did you take me away from watching my sheep? What have you gotten me into?” Wouldn’t things have gone much easier for David if God simply removed Saul in some way? Why does God have to make things so complicated?
