_“Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:8_

As those who stand with the Lord in His ascension, two particular things will happen. As we have already seen, the first thing is that we will be involved in spiritual warfare. Now we come to the second: we will possess the Lord’s heavenly vantage point, for we are proceeding together with the Lord "from Lebanon.”

We are never alone when we are in the Lord’s ascension. He never leaves us to fight the spiritual warfare on our own. When we enter into ascension with the Lord, the Lord is with us to experience the reality of all the spiritual things. He is with us from Lebanon, from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, and from the lions’ dens and leopards’ mountains. We will have the same mind as the Lord, and we will be in one accord with Him for the carrying out of God’s eternal desire through His work on the earth.
