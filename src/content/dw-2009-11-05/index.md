_“Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.” — Ruth 3:2_ Naomi told Ruth, “Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative?” In other words, do you not have a living Christ? And do you not have companions in the church life? “In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.” Winnowing is the process by which the wind is used to separate the shell of threshed grain from its kernel. Barley signifies resurrection, but resurrection cannot be fully realized as long as there are shells. When the shell is winnowed away, then the life, or fruit, of barley is manifested and can be dispensed into people.

Boaz, who signifies the Lord, was going to do something at that time, and Naomi, who cared for Ruth, knew what he would do. On the one hand, Ruth had passed through some experiences of gleaning wheat and barley. She had a level of maturity that she had not possessed before. On the other hand, she needed some further perfecting. Boaz was moving, and Ruth was ready. Naomi was the unique one who could put these two together. To have the ability to recognize this opportunity and act on it was not a small thing.
