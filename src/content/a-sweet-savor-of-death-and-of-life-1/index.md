> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 2:14-15, KJV

This verse offends everybody – people don't like this verse. But \[Paul\] says, “_To the one we are the savour of death unto death_. Don't you know what my function is? My function is to send people to hell. When I walk around, many people smell me. After they smell me, they go to hell, hallelujah." You say, Paul, how can you do this? He says, “I don't play God. God is God. I have my portion, God has His portion. My portion is to take care of myself before God. God's portion is to take care of who should be saved, who should not be saved. None of my business, right?” So he said clearly, “To the one we are the savour of death unto death.”
