According to the Bible, every human being is a vessel. Romans 9:21 says,

_Does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?_

Now that we are saved, we have become vessels unto honor, because as vessels we contain Godâ€™s divine life. Through all our circumstances, we gain Him and reign through Him. In this way, God is fulfilling His eternal purpose.
