> For _our_ commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour
> 
> â€” Philippians 3:20 Darby

For over fifty years I have been enjoying a church life in which I have grown in this heavenly commonwealth, being brought to Christ by all my fellow citizens. Even in times of weaknesses, I have been helped by my fellow citizens to turn again and again to experience Christ as the inward content of this commonwealth.
