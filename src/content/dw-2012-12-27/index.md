_But when David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How the king of Israel distinguished himself today! He uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants’ maids as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!”_ _So David said to Michal, “It was before the Lord, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel; therefore I will celebrate before the Lord._ _— Second Samuel 6:20-21_

David’s answer, when Michal rebuked him, was very good: “It was before the Lord, who chose me...to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel. Therefore I will play music before the Lord” (v. 21).
