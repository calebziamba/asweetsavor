_\[You\] have put on the new man, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all. — Colossians 3:10-11_

I have been considering why the matter of oneness is not mentioned in the book of Colossians. It has been said that what the Bible does not say is often as important as what it does say. When I first heard this statement as a young man, it made no sense to me, for there is no way to even begin to list the innumerable things the Bible doesn’t say. But it is significant that the matter of oneness is spoken of strongly in Ephesians, and yet it is not mentioned at all in Colossians. Oneness is mentioned in Paul’s other crucial epistles, such as Romans and Philippians, yet when you come to Colossians, which is one of Paul’s richest and highest writings, it is seemingly absent.
