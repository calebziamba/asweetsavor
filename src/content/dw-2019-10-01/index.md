_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25–30_

Paul was a prisoner in Rome living in a rented house while awaiting his trial before Caesar (Acts 28:16, 30). In addition to paying rent, he had to pay the expense of the guards constantly watching him. Although he had such expenses, he could not get a job, because he was a prisoner. In spite of the fact that Paul had collected money for those in need in Jerusalem (Rom. 15:25–26; 1 Cor. 16:1–3; 2 Cor. 8:1–5; 9:1–5), there is no indication that the church in Jerusalem took care of him while he was imprisoned in Rome.

Paul was in a very difficult situation. Probably many gossiped about him, saying, “He does not keep the law, even though the Lord Jesus kept it. He does not keep the Sabbath or administer circumcision.” Paul was strongly disliked, even hated, by the Judaizers. No doubt all the churches raised up by Paul were wondering what they should do, especially those in Asia Minor, since they were geographically closer to Jerusalem. Though Paul was in real need financially, he did not receive any care from the churches in Asia Minor, nor from any other church except Philippi (Phil. 4:14–18), which sent Epaphroditus to him with a gift. Epaphroditus remained in Rome to minister to Paul’s need.
