_So David came to Saul and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer. — First Samuel 16:21_

_And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul’s hand. And Saul cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice. — First Samuel 18:10-11_ Two major items that the Lord tests are our purity and our view. This was David’s experience. He became the prevailing warrior in the kingdom, outshining Saul, yet he carried Saul’s armor. David still honored Saul as God’s anointed. David’s view was that, since God anointed him, he would stand with him.

If David had a natural view, he would have sought to hasten Saul’s death to make it clear who the Lord’s anointed was. All David had to do, it seemed, was to refuse to play his harp for Saul, for then the evil spirit might have driven him mad or caused him to kill himself. If David simply had the throne in view, he might have done such a thing, but David was very pure. In his view, since God had anointed him, God was responsible for his kingship to be manifest. David did not have to do anything on his own behalf. This is not an easy lesson to learn.
