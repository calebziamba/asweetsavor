In this new position in the heavenly places in Christ we receive every spiritual blessing, as referred to in Ephesians 1:3:

_Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ._

Thus, according to the Bible, we do not have to wait to go to heaven, for we have already been seated there with Christ! And in our new position in the heavenlies, we have been blessed with every spiritual blessing in Him.
