_In Him was life.... — John 1:4a_

_I came that they might have life.... — John 10:10b_

On one hand we can say that the life of God came into us. Yet on the other hand we must realize that when this life came into us, the Triune God Himself came into us. The life of God is inseparable from God Himself. God the Father came into us, God the Son came into us, and God the Spirit came into us. The Triune God came into us as the eternal life. Now God is no longer outside of us. The moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Triune God came into us. When we were born again, God came into us as life.
