_I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad. Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together. — Psalm 34:1-3_

There are multiple reasons why we might consider giving up the Lord. We might be caught by sin or worldliness, but the main reason is that the Lord no longer holds the first place in our heart. Too often we gauge our spiritual condition by how victorious we are, but David’s measure was the Lord’s presence.

His secret was that he only wanted the Lord. Whether he was victorious or defeated, he sought the Lord’s presence. This became the secret of everything he did from this time forward. We will experience both days of victory and days of defeat, but either way, we need to remain in the Lord’s presence. No matter what we are going through, we need to remain with the Lord, learning to trust Him in all things.
