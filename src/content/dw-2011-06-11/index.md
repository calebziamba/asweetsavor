_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

We should be careful of saying that we are too “tight” financially, especially those of us who serve the Lord full-time. This may show that our house and God’s tabernacle are two different things in our concept. Sometimes when we offer to the Lord financially we think that we are generous. We may even feel that we are offering too much.

Actually, we should never consider ourselves generous in our offering to the Lord. To think this way shows that our understanding is wrong. The Lord would tell us, “Don’t think that you have offered so much. All that you have belongs to Me. It is Mine anyway.” We need to become mature so that we can have a full and complete consecration to the Lord.

When we arrive at true maturity we no longer separate what is ours from what is His. We no longer think, “This belongs to me, and that belongs to Him.” Nor do we think, “I have given something to the Lord. Now I am entitled to some kind of blessing in return.” When we reach the stage of maturity we realize, “The Lord’s tabernacle is my house, and my house is His tabernacle. I do not have my own house or my own life. The church life is just my life.”
