_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

A normal, seeking Christian should labor on the Song of Songs. We should be familiar with it and pay the price to experience all the riches revealed in it. If we are equipped in this way, we will be able to work with the Lord in our environment.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 13.
