_You are My friends if you do what I command you._ _– John 15:14_

Only you know what your real problems are. If you say that you have no problems, then you must be God Himself. If you are not God, then surely you have problems and anxieties in your daily life. So what can you do? You should learn to enjoy Christ as a living person by opening your whole being to Him with all of your problems. He is your Friend, and He will listen to you. He knows, He understands, and He can fellowship with you and restore you.
