_For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren._ _– Romans 8:29_

The first major section of Romans (1:18–5:11) covers our condemnation and justification. The second section (5:12–8:39) covers our organic salvation. Romans 5 emphasizes our inheritance in Adam, Romans 6 emphasizes our obtainment in Christ, Romans 7 emphasizes the controlling power of the flesh, and Romans 8 emphasizes our deliverance in the Holy Spirit.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, pages 14-15.
