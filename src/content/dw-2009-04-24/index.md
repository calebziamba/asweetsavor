_Then he said to me, "These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah; then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters of the sea become fresh.” — Ezekiel 47:8_ When the Lord's testimony among us is upheld to such an extent that the flow becomes powerful, it will flow all the way eastward to the sea. According to this portion in Ezekiel, the river flows all the way to a sea that is actually dead. When the flow from God's house reaches it, however, “the water of the sea is healed” (Ezek. 47:8).

What is this “dead sea” today? Some may feel that the United States and Canada make up such a dead sea, for there seems to be little response to the word of life among Americans and Canadians as compared to people elsewhere. We should realize, however, that if there truly is a flow of life issuing out of the church life, it won't matter who is American or who is Canadian. The flow comes to the dead sea and makes it alive! The flow doesn't care what nationality it encounters; it makes all alive. It is all a matter of flow. If in your local church there is a flow, that flow will make the dead sea alive. It will produce fish, and it will make the salty water sweet.
