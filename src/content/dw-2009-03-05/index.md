_Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power._

_For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those in Laodicea, even all who have not seen my face in the flesh.... — Colossians 1:28 - 2:1_

A brother once told me, “Titus, in your area there are so many churches that have been raised up and so many saints in the church life.” That is true, but according to my feeling it is not a matter of how many saints or churches there are, but of how many people have been perfected. If I cannot perfect others through my speaking, my speaking is in vain.

This is why I do not like to travel so much anymore. Brother Lee once said, “I am afraid of traveling,” but I did not understand what he meant at the time. Now I do. He had become wary of giving messages. I too have become afraid of giving messages. I do not have a burden to give messages. I only have a burden for people. Because of you, I am full of burden. Were it not for you, I would have no burden to speak.
