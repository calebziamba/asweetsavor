_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

If the psalmist realizes that his house and God’s house are the same, then why can’t he be restful? Why must he be so desperate? A house should be a place of rest. We might tell the psalmist, “Not only do you have a house, but your house is God’s house. Now you can rest. There is no need to be so desperate.” But the psalmist would tell us, “No! In God’s house I will not go up to my bed! I cannot have any rest! I will not even give sleep to my eyes!”
