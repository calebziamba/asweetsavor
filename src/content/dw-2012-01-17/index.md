_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the edge of his garments. — Psalm 133:1-2_

What is described in these verses should become very practical for us. We often feel it is too much for us to serve in the church life, even just once a week. We especially look down upon the practical serving, such as cleaning the hall, setting up chairs, or mowing the lawn. If this is the case, then how can we have “Aaron’s beard” among us? It often seems instead that we have “Jacob’s beard,” because we always murmur and complain. We complain that some saints do too much, while others do too little. But this is contrary to Psalm 133.

We should desire to see a harmonious church life in maturity, with the divine ointment flowing down upon us, so that we can declare, “Behold! How good and how pleasant it is!” For this to happen we need to have Christ as our Head and as our person. We need to grow until Christ Himself is our maturity. This maturity will cause us to serve as a priest in the church life. When there are many saints among us who exercise in maturity, then the church life will become a priestly serving life.
