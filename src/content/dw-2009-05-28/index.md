_“You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women.” — Ruth 2:8_ Our field is the church life. We should enjoy the church life where the Lord has sovereignly placed us. Just as Ruth was instructed to stay close by the young women, we also need companions; we should not be solitary Christians. Boaz continued, “Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them” (v. 9). We should be watchful to see where the reaping is taking place so that we can pick up the food as it becomes available. We should keep our eyes on Christ and on those who are pioneering ahead of us. In this way, we will receive the blessing.
