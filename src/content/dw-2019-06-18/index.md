_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

If we abide in this experience, remaining in the inner chamber of our spirit, we will grow in our relationship with the Lord. In contrast, we cannot grow if we are always busy in the outer court. We must be in His chambers and have this special relationship with Him, for only then can we really follow Him. We must not focus so much on our works, but instead, spend more time in the King’s chambers.
