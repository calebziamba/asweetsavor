_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

Isn’t the Lord’s work more crucial than any sick individual? Based on this, we might think Paul should have written to Philippi, “Don’t you know who I am in the Lord’s work? The one you sent to me is not fitting for the magnitude of the task. Send me a replacement soon.” This very way of thinking damages the Lord’s work. Many seem to have lost the element of the humanity of Jesus. To them, how the individual believers are doing is no longer important when compared to the overall situation of the Lord’s work. However, the believers themselves are the key. The well-being of each believer is the most important element in the church life.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 168.
