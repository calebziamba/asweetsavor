_“Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight. Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking." — Ruth 3:2-3_

Sometimes we feel prevailing and hopeful. Maybe we have just given a good testimony. We feel so acceptable at that time. Or maybe we feel our years as a Christian have made us more acceptable to the Lord than others who seem further down the ladder. No, we should only bring to the Lord and consecrate to Him what He has done in us. The clothing we wear must be the Lord Himself, who has become our covering and the constitution of our living.

Clothing in the Bible often typifies our living and behavior. When we come to the Lord, we must realize that we have nothing to brag about. Instead we must say, “Lord, I have loved You so many years, but all that I can bring is what You have worked into me as my clothing, washing, and anointing. Something of You is now in me, and this is all that I have with which to meet You.”
