_I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman. — John 15:1_

_I am the vine, you are the branches. — John 15:5_

Finally, we should enjoy Christ as the true vine. John 15:1 is a famous verse, but very few people understand it. Christ is not only the vine tree itself; He is also the very life of the vine. There is a true union between us, who are the branches, and Christ, who is the life of the vine.

“I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing” (John 15:5). As the branches, we receive the life of the vine and express all the riches of the vine tree. When we were born again, we received the life of the vine and became part of the vine tree. Now we are one with Christ as the branches in the true vine.
