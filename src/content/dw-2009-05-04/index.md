If you desire to be one with the New Testament ministry, you have to dig into the riches of the ministry and become acquainted with them.Ã‚Â  On the one hand, we should study the riches, and on the other hand, we must know how to live before the Lord. We have to contact Him, meet with Him, fellowship with Him and get close to Him. We must allow the Spirit to work on us, and we must experience God continually so that we might be constituted with the divine life. Such a divine constitution will issue in a spirit of the divine attributes. This is the way to experience being constituted with the divine attributes.

We should have a spirit that transmits the divine attributes. We should tell the Lord, “Lord, I ask that You would work on me to make me a person full of the divine riches. I desire to be spiritual. I want to be a man of God and to live in the divine nature with high expectations and high revelation. I desire to be one who can supply others, bringing them into God's economy.” Such a person is truly a servant of the Lord.

It is not enough to simply serve the church or even to become a “full-timer.” We must have such a vision. If we do not serve with such a realization, our labor will be in vain.
