The more you pursue the Lord, the more imperfect you should find yourself to be. Before you loved the Lord, you felt you were a nice person. After you began loving the Lord, you felt as if nothing was right. You didn’t even grow well. This would push you to be with the Lord more and to focus on the leading of the Lord, being under the Lord’s control, and being one with the Lord. This is the healthy process of cultivating your personality.
