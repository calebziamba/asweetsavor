_“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;_ _I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam._ _I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;_ _I have drunk my wine and my milk._ _Eat, friends;_ _Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:1_

In this union of life and love the Lord says, “I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.” Myrrh, spice, honeycomb, honey, wine, and milk are all types of what issues from the Lord in resurrection. At this stage, the Lord enjoys the fruits of His labor in His seeking one.
