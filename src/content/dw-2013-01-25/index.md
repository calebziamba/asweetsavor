__“Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,_ _May you come with me from Lebanon._ _Journey down from the summit of Amana,_ _From the summit of Senir and Hermon,_ _From the dens of lions,_ _From the mountains of leopards.”_ _— Song of Songs 4:8__

As the Lord calls us forward to be with Him in His ascension, He emphasizes that we need to put on the armor, which is the church. We have to know that we are not by ourselves anymore.

It doesn’t matter how spiritual or how effective we are. Now we must live in the church life and allow the Body to be our protection. It doesn’t matter whether the church is strong or weak. The church is our armor to fight against Satan.

As He calls us forward the Lord also shows us that we are living in the victory of the cross. We must be in continual union with the Lord to experience all the riches of the cross.
