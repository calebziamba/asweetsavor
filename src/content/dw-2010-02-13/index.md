It takes time to equip the heart. No one was born with a perfect heart, nor did anyone have a perfect heart when he first came to Christ. The Lord might lead a newly saved person to consecrate himself, but this is likely only something of emotion. His mind and will still need equipping.

It is not an easy matter to deal with your heart. Regardless  of where you are or what your environment is, you must fight for your heart, that it may be properly equipped.
