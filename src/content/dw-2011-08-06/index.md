_“Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.” — Joshua 1:7_

God repeats again to Joshua that he had to be strong and very courageous in order that he might observe the laws He had given through Moses, not turning to the left or the right (v. 7). These laws are God’s words. Today, these words are the Bible. When we have His Word and we abide in it, we can rise up and take the land.

Adapted from _[Joshua: A Life of Service,](/book-joshua "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 42-43.
