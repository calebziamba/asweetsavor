> More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8

Anything that replaces or crowds out Christ will damage our church life. If the focus among us is some doctrine or practice rather than Christ, our church life has become contaminated. We need to be before the Lord and pray, “Lord, be merciful to us so that in our church life there is no contaminating rubbish. We want to be occupied only with You.”
