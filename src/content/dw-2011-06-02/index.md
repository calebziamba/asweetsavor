Some of us have been in the church life for a long period of time. After being in the church life for many years it is easy for us to develop an attitude of indifference. We begin to say to ourselves, “What’s the point? Nothing works. All of the conferences and trainings are good, but afterwards we are always the same. We have heard about so many high things, but in practice they all seem ineffective. There is no impact. It just doesn’t matter.”
