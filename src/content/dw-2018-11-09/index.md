_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit._ _– John 12:24_

Our Lord Jesus did not go through the process of death and resurrection just for the sake of experiencing that process. Rather, He endured it in order to bear fruit (John 12:24). Consider how many believers have been regenerated through the centuries, all produced through the labor of the Lord Jesus.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 149.
