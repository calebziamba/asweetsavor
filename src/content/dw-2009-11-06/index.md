_Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed of the Jehovah who has not withdrawn his kindness to the living and to the dead." Again Naomi said to her, "The man is our relative, he is one of our closest relatives." — Ruth 2:20_ Naomi could have been content to receive the grain that Ruth had been collecting under Boaz's generosity. They might have accumulated quite a portion by that time. They might have been comfortable, even well-off. If Naomi had not cared for Ruth's further perfecting, she might have been happy with what Ruth was producing. Ruth had gleaned through at least two harvests; she had a good job with a steady income. Spiritually, we might say to one we are with, “Praise the Lord! He has blessed you bountifully, and you are experiencing a sweet church life.”

Perhaps Ruth kept bringing home her ephah of grain daily. There was blessing. In the church life, perhaps this could be interpreted as increase or enrichment. But Naomi was not controlled by this; she was concerned with Ruth's continual progress. In actuality, Ruth was dying. Apparently she was doing well, but if she could not take the next step prepared for her, she would begin to languish. Therefore Naomi was watching desperately for an opportunity for Ruth to take this next step.
