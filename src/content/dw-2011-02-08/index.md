_Now the young man Samuel was ministering to the Lord under Eli. And the word of the Lord was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision. At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place. â€” First Samuel 3:1-2

_Samuel served the Lord as a priest, which was made more difficult because he had to serve under Eli, whose eyes had begun to grow dim.

To serve under anyone who is not too clear can be a real dealing. If those taking the lead in a church are not clear, many drastic things can happen. Serious problems that should be handled may not be dealt with, and positive things, such as the move of the Spirit, may be missed. If we, like Samuel, have the right kind of heart, we can learn from both the negative and positive in others.
