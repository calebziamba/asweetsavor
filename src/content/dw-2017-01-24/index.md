_For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building._ _– First Corinthians 3:9_

This verse  shows us that we have become God’s building. God is doing something with us all the time. On the one hand, God is tilling us so that His life can grow in us, and on the other hand, God is building us together to be His corporate testimony.
