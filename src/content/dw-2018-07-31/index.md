_For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._ _– Romans 5:10_

Romans chatpers 5-8 focus mainly on organic salvation and emphasize one thing: we who have been regenerated need to grow in God’s life until we are inwardly sanctified and outwardly glorified with Christ. This growth is through the process of organic salvation, which is completely a matter of life.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 15.
