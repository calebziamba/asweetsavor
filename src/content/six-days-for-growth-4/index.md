You must intimately walk with Christ. Some people have a vision, they don't spend 6 days — they spend no days. They still have the vision. Some people have a vision and they spend their whole life in that vision. They refuse to go up. The Lord says, “Well, you have to have the vision. Spend 6 days in that vision. After 6 days, you must be willing to come up with Me to another stage of height.” You can declare, “I have nothing. I have no one but Christ alone.” This is the background of this new stage, the new scene, of this Christ.
