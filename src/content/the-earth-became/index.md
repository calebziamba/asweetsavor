_In this series we look at how Titus Chu uses the Bible to portray the many stages of our lives as Christians, and how they drive our spiritual growth. We are currently looking at the portrayal of such stages in the creation story of Genesis chapter 1._

Last week, we talked about Genesis 1:1, where we saw that God initiates many “beginnings” in our lives, including making us born again and our beginning to love Him. The more beginnings God initiates in us, the more ground for growth becomes available. This is marvelous! However, after this marvelous word, we find Genesis 1:2, which says “but the earth became without form and void.” The great work of God is met with a “but” which leads to a low condition that is “without form” and “void.”

> “But” is when you get used to something. I know it. I’m habitual with it. I know, it’s time to sing a song. I know it’s time to sit up. I know it’s time for two brothers to stand up and read some verse\[s\]. Then I know Titus will come up to do the show. Then I know the meeting is finished — let’s all stand up and have some prayer. “I know.” Brothers, that is “but it became.”

> You want to gain Christ, **but** you’re doing things for Christ rather than gaining Christ. You want to build the church, **but** end up serving the church rather than building the church. You want to know the Word, **but** you use the Word to preach rather than really know the Word. Then you want to grow and develop, **but** you are occupied with activities rather than really growing.

> Unconsciously, as we are zealously serving God day-by-day, spiritual things become common, serving becomes common, laboring becomes common, and even pursuing becomes unconsciously common.

Titus is warning us of the potential for routine and stagnation in our Christian life. Even when we have genuine and fresh beginning work in us from God, these things can become common and routine in our lives. Our life of pursuing Christ and meeting with the saints becomes full of activity but lacking in real development. When we find ourselves in such a state, we are “without form and void.”

I remember experiencing this when, after graduating from college and returning to my home church, I had a desire to shepherd the youth there. Once a week on Saturday night, we met in a different home in the city. We would eat dinner and then read the Bible. The first few weeks were so refreshing! They were filled with energy and God was really with us! However, after just a couple months it began to feel like a chore. Less families were ready to open their homes to us, I had a harder time finding stories from the Bible to read and share with the students, and attendance became less regular. I felt spiritually defeated. The endeavor which started so well “became without form and void.”

From this grim state we see something at work in Genesis 1:2: “the Spirit of God was hovering and brooding over the face of the waters.” Even in the gloomy state of a formless and void world, God is still at work. 

> “Wherever we are, the Spirit of God hovers and broods over us, just like a hen raising up her chicks.”

It is so reassuring that our God is so present in our lives. When the “but” comes in and our living becomes “without form and void,” God’s Spirit is so present! I really appreciate this word “brooding” because it shows God’s intimate and enduring care for us. Then from this brooding the first thing we experience is that God says “Let there be light!” (Genesis 1:3).

> When spiritual things to us become habitual without Christ, religious actions without life, or responsibilities without burden, God would come and declare to us, “Let light become!” This is to restore our whole being again into a healthy state.

God then divides the light from the darkness, creating “Day” and “Night.” The Days are the buoyant and prevailing times; the Nights are the hard times. But, the change from Day to Night is not sudden; instead, there is “evening and the morning.” This is a gradual change.

> Morning leads you to day: you have Christ, you have the light of Christ, you have the enjoyment of Christ, you have the feeding of Christ, you have the nourishing of Christ, you have the strengthening of Christ, you know your way so clearly, your Christian life becomes so buoyant, and you declare “hallelujah, I love the Lord!” But remember: if you always want “hallelujah!” and “I love the Lord”, you are not going to grow very well. Hard times are coming.
> 
> For some reason, gradually you find out that freshness is not enjoyable anymore. Something is inadequate. You know that, Lord, you’re bringing me into something else. And unconsciously, gradually, you realize, wow. How dark. Don’t despise how dark. Love how dark — because only when darkness is here do you know how to appreciate the Day.

Through this cycle of evenings and mornings, God is able to become so full and real in our lives. We can experience Him in our highs and in our lows. How has your experience of “Day” helped you to endure the “Night”? How have your “Nights” helped you to appreciate the “Days?”
