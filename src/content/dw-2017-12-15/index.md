_Do not love the world nor the things in the world....For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from Father, but is from the world_ _– 1 John 2:15–16_

None of us would seek to be recognized as the greatest sinner, for that is shameful and of the flesh. However, we may compete to be recognized as the most spiritual. This is related to the lust of the eyes.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 128.
