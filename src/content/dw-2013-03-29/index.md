_“Why have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.” – Second Samuel 12:9_

We must be careful, for if we find ourselves thinking we have gained some status among the Lord’s children, we also may feel we can say and do what others cannot. Others must read the Bible, but not us. Others must have a time to pray, but we no longer have such a need. Others must rise up to touch the Lord in the morning, but this no longer applies to us who are more senior.

This is wrong. Regardless how spiritual we become, we should never despise the commandment of the Lord (2 Sam. 12:9). The more mature we are, the more we should value the practices that lead to a healthy Christian life and church life. We should never feel we are above such things.
