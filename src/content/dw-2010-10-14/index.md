_“Let them construct a sanctuary for Me, that I may dwell among them. According to all that I am going to show you, as the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture, just so you shall construct it.” — Exodus 25:8-9_

God told Moses to make Him a sanctuary according to the pattern He revealed to him on the mountain (Exo. 25:9). It was no longer a matter of feasting. God desired something further. He wanted the children of Israel to build a sanctuary, a tabernacle, with every detail matching the pattern He unveiled upon the mountain.

Many Christians experience human organization among God’s people. Fewer learn to focus on Christ. Very, very few, however, learn to care only for the Lord’s testimony, His habitation among His people. This, however, is the goal. Everything we do and have in the church life should be according to the heavenly pattern God has unveiled to us.
