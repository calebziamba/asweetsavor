_“You have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary. But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love.” — Revelation 2:3-4_

In His word to the seven churches in Revelation, the Lord said the church in Ephesus labored and endured and tested those who call themselves apostles, but left their first love. Thus the Lord had no way among them. The church in Laodicea talked, preached, and spoke about the Lord, but the Lord was not among them. He stood at the door and knocked, but because of the problem with their heart, they did not respond.
