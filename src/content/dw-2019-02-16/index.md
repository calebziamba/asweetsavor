_I recall your tears._  
_– 2 Timothy 1:4_

If we have been Christians for many years and have never shed tears, we must be very lonely and isolated. When we see fellow believers suffering, we shed tears because we partake of their sufferings, and when they experience joy, we shed tears of joy with them (Rom. 12:15). Our tears indicate our genuine participation.

_by Titus Chu, pages 156-157.
