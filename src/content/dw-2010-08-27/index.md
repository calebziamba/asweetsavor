_“We will make you plaits of gold with studs of silver.” — Song of Songs 1:11_

The cross works on you with little sympathy, regardless of your willingness. When God says, “We will make you plaits of gold,” He surely will do it. The process of making you plaits of gold is a fine work. He will completely divide your hair, and He will exhaust you to the extent that you feel there is no way to go on. Eventually, however, when God knits your hair together, you will find that something has been added to you.
