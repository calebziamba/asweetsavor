_Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. — Exodus 19:5

But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. — First Peter 2:9

_The Lord told Moses that the people’s responsibility was simply to keep their focus upon Him. This is why He said that if they would obey His voice and keep His covenant, they would become His treasure on the earth (Exo. 19:5). God loves every human being, but once we become Christians, we become very special to Him. Among all peoples, we are His special treasure.
