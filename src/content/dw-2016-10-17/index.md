_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._ _—Philippians 2:8_

Christ’s obedience involved not just His action but even more, His attitude. The Greek word for “humble” here is _tapeinóo_, which can also mean “abase, bring low” (Strong, no. 5013). Christ took a submissive attitude toward God in all things. His whole being was geared to the Father as the One with authority. He was attentive to whatever God had to say, becoming obedient even to the point of death.

Adapted from _[Philippians: “That I May Gain Christ”](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_, page 110.
