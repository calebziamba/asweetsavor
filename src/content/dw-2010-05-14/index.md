_And I have made Your name known to them and will yet make it known, that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them. — John 17:26_

We may have brothers in the church life who are very good. The first brother does not love the world, the second brother is filled in spirit, the third brother is sanctified in the word, and the fourth brother declares the name of Jesus. When they are together, everything is wonderful and there is a rich supply. But when the fifth brother says, “Let’s go watch a movie,” he brings everyone into something else. What should the other brothers do?

It would be quite easy for them to get rid of this brother and keep their good fellowship. But the Bible tells us to love all the brothers. So instead of throwing the fifth brother out, they should try to help this brother by admonishing him and turning him to love Jesus, a much better alternative than going to the movie theater. This brother who received the help will then be so thankful. He is helped not merely because he was corrected, but because some brothers showed him love. This becomes the last item of the process for the fulfillment of the Lord’s prayer in John 17.
