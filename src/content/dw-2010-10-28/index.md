_O Jehovah, my heart is not proud, nor are my eyes haughty; Nor do I go about in things too great or too wondrous for me. — Psalm 131:1_

When saints are young in the church life they often think that they are important. Because they are so zealous to give themselves to the Lord, they feel that they are the hope for the church’s future. Eventually they have opinions about the elders and the older saints. They even become disdainful. They may think, “Who are these elders? They are all so ‘out-of-date.’ We are the hope for the Lord’s recovery!” This means that their eyes have become “haughty.” They consider themselves to be higher than the other saints.
