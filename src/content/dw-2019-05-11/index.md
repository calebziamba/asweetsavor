_“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:2, KJV_

This should be our experience all our life. We should live in this feeling all our days: “Let Him!” We do not have to explain who He is. He is the One who has ravished our heart. We have, with Him, an unspeakable, sweet, and sublime relationship.
