> â€”Philippians 3:10

Each of us has our own view of what it means to follow the Lord. This becomes a great frustration to Him. What seems very reasonable to us can frustrate what Christ wants to do. Our single object must be to gain and obtain Christ. We must let go of all other things. Resurrection power can rescue us from the limitation of our logic.

From [Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/) by Titus Chu, p. 197
