The marvelous beginning of Genesis 1 was marred by the phrase, "But the earth became without form and void" (1:2). How did God rescue the earth, and how does He rescue us, out of such a degraded situation? The end of Genesis 1:2 says, "And the Spirit of God was hovering and brooding over the face of the waters."

This message excerpt is taken from the 2017 Winter Conference, held in Cleveland Ohio. The title of the conference was, "The Marvelous Signs of the Divine Growth."
