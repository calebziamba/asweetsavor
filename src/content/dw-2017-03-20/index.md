_By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed._ _â€“ Hebrews 11:8_

Abraham represents all who are called by God. From him we see what marks the life of the called ones: everything depends on God. When we truly walk the way of the Lord, we discover that everything depends on Him. We may rely on ourselves when we preach the gospel, read the Bible, or serve the church. However, if we desire to walk the way of the Lord and answer His call, we cannot rely on ourselves but on Him. He must be our unique source. Without Him, we have no way to go forward. Without His protection and provision, we are finished. Our every step must be in God. He is the way of the called ones.
