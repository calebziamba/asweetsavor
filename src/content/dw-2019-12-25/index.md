_“Behold, you are beautiful,  
my beloved,_ _truly delightful.  
Our couch is green.”  
– Song of Songs 1:16, ESV  
_

“Green” in this verse may also be translated “of grass.” \[...\] Psalm 23:2 says, “He makes me lie down in green pastures.” This indicates that it is life that provides us with the basis for our lying down. Why do we have rest? It is not because we have accomplished some labor, succeeded in some preaching, or attained some learning. Rather, it is because we have experienced the life of the Lord; it is because the Lord supplies us with His life. We have a life relationship with the Lord, so we can testify, “Our couch is green.” Brothers and sisters, I am afraid that for many of us, our couch is rarely green. If we love the Lord and truly consecrate ourselves to the Lord we will say, “Lord, thank You that my couch is green.”
