_It is vain for you to rise up early, to lie down late, To eat the bread of toil; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep. Behold, children are a gift of Jehovah, The fruit of the womb is a reward. — Psalm 127:2-3_

_But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen; and some are unto honor, and some unto dishonor. If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work. — Second Timothy 2:20-21_ We need to ask for the Lord's mercy that we would never be wooden or earthen vessels. Christianity is filled with these vessels. Many in Christianity are trying to do something to serve the Lord, yet everything they do is with human hands and according to their natural concepts. Many people carry out Christian works in the name of the Lord, yet what they produce has almost nothing to do with Him. These are the vessels unto dishonor.
