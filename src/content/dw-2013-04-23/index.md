_He is also Head of the Body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything._ _– Colossians 1:18_

First Corinthians, Second Corinthians, and Galatians are all somewhat negative in tone, and deal with some basic problems in the church life. However, the next group of Paul’s epistles—Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians—is very sweet.

According to these three epistles, once we are saved, we are in the church; this is Ephesians. Because we are in the church life, we should pursue only Christ; this is Philippians. When we pursue only Christ, He reveals His headship; this is Colossians. Here we have three great items: the church, the pursuit of Christ, and Christ’s headship.
