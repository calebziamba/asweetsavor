_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_ If we develop an attitude of indifference after being in the church life for some time, it only shows that we need to grow unto maturity. We need to exercise according to what is described in Psalm 132.

This psalm shows us a person who realizes something of the Lord’s testimony. He knows that God has a habitation among His people. However, the psalmist also realizes, “We are short of reality. We are short of substance.” Instead of feeling discouraged or becoming indifferent, he rises up and begins to fight. He fights for the reality of what he has seen.
