_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._ _—Philippians 2:8_

He died forsaken, alone, and bearing all the weight of the world’s sin and rebellion against God, until even God had to give Him up as though He were the source of all that was wrong, as though He were the unique perpetrator of every sin ever committed against God (1 Pet. 2:24). He declared, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” (Matt. 27:46). This was the death unto which the Lord was obedient.
