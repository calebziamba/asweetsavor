Our attitude toward the saints should be, “Dear saints, please give me the Christ you have experienced so that I may be enlarged and be refreshed. I need the Lord, and I also need you. Now I am desperate, for I do not know what to do. It seems that morning watch, fastings, prayers, or the church meetings cannot help me; I need something more. Oh Lord, I am sick with love. Brothers and sisters, please help me.” At such a time, it seems that while our dependence is on the Lord, our help actually comes from the other brothers and sisters.
