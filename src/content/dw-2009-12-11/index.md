_“It shall be when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do.” — Ruth 3:4_ Like Ruth, we need to take note of where the Lord lies down. This is where we must go to consecrate ourselves to the living person of Christ, not anywhere else. We cannot just lie down in the field and say, “Praise the Lord, I am in the church life!” We have to come to the exact place where the Lord is.
