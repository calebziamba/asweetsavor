_“Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock, Where do you make it lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?”_

_“If you yourself do not know, Most beautiful among women, Go forth in the footsteps of the flock And pasture your young goats By the shepherds’ tents.” — Song of Songs 1:7-8_

Those who begin to follow the Lord should personally pursue the growth of life on one hand, and they should know the footsteps of the flock on the other. The footsteps of the flock grant us confidence that our labor is of the Lord. The Lord did not call us to follow Him on our own. The Lord will not ask us to leave the rich supply in the church. Even when we have some young “goats” to take care of, we need to pasture them by the shepherds’ tents.
