_Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the Lord our God, Until He is gracious to us. — Psalm 123:2_ Even though the experience of discipline can be hard, this verse is so joyful. When we have a proper consecration before the Lord we begin to realize, “Lord, with You as my Master I am not so free anymore. I cannot run wild. I cannot do whatever I want to do. All I can do is keep my eyes on Your hand.”

This is very different from being a “professional consecrator.” A “professional consecrator” prays all the time, “Lord, I give myself to You,” but he always lives his own life and does his own thing. We must desire to have the reality of consecration, especially in our behavior. This means we must pray, “Lord, I am willing for my whole life to be disciplined by You. I look unto Your hand, and I look to You for Your mercy.”
