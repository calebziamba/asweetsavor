_Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the Lord our God, Until He is gracious to us. — Psalm 123:2_ The Lord's hand to us, is, firstly, a hand of supply. Whenever we look unto Him we receive the life-supply. His hand is also a hand of support. Support is needed when we are not able to receive the supply. The Lord is very merciful. When we are not able to receive His life-supply, then His hand will come in to support us. When we are able to receive His supply, then His hand supplies us with everything we need. He not only supplies us with life, but also with the proper church life, the best companions, and the best environment. All of these items are out of His hand. He also supplies us with all our inward needs. He supplies us with life, light, strength, and enjoyment. The Lord's hand is a hand of supply that meets all of our needs.
