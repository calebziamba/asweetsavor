_And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. — Acts 2:42_

The following points admonish us to be vigilant to safeguard the genuine one accord, rather than to force something on others according to our concept: · The heavenly one accord cannot be an imposition, or it will lead to an inquisition, e.g., the history of the Catholic Church. · The heavenly one accord is not a matter of uniformity without variety, e.g., the Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses. · The heavenly one accord is not merely according to the same spiritual or human goal and commitment, e.g., many mission boards in Christianity. · The heavenly one accord is not merely according to the same teaching apart from the teaching of God’s economy. · The heavenly one accord is not merely according to the same practices. · The heavenly one accord is not merely according to the same common interests, such as race, language, social status, age, etc.
