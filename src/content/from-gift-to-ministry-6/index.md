Everyone is quick to proclaim they have a ministry, yet very few realize that God is the one who operates. It is not the ministry which operates. You have a ministry, but you don't operate. God operates.

Excerpted from _[A Ministry and Not a Work](https://www.asweetsavor.org/a-ministry-and-not-a-work/)_ from the _[1978 Labor Day Weekend Conference](https://www.asweetsavor.org/1978-labor-day-weekend-conference/)_
