_“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;_ _I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam._ _I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;_ _I have drunk my wine and my milk._ _Eat, friends;_ _Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers.”_ _— Song of Songs 5:1_

As chapter 5 begins, the king again refers to the Shulammite maiden as “my sister, my bride.” The Lord and His lovers have a relationship that is of life and love. The term “sister” refers to their relation in life, and the term “bride” refers to their relationship of love. In life, we are the Lord’s sisters, and in love, we are His bride.
