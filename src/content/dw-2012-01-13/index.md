_Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell  together in unity!_ _It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard, Coming down upon the edge of his garments. — Psalm 133:1-2_

The enjoyment and experience of the divine anointing comes from our oneness. According to this psalm, the anointing oil runs down upon the head. This means that we need the headship of Christ. The anointing oil comes down upon the head, and then runs down from the head to the body.

In the Bible the head also refers to the person. When we have Christ’s headship, we also have His person. The oneness described in this psalm can only be displayed in the church life if all of the saints are in submission to Christ’s headship. Every saint must be under Christ’s headship for true oneness to be realized. This oneness will cause us to enjoy the divine anointing.
