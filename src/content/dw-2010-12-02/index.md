_I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. —Romans 12:1_ We all desire to serve in the church life, and we all desire to be in one accord. One accord means that we have a common, mutual sacrifice. We all sacrifice ourselves together to attain the desire of the Lord. To have the one accord is not merely being together and loving one another. To have the one accord we must know the secret of death. Die to yourself. Don’t argue, don’t insist, and don’t aim at something flourishing or beautiful.

The highest thing is Christ. For this Christ, for this highest service, we must all learn to put ourselves to death. Those who are in one accord are those who have died. One accord comes from the application of death.
