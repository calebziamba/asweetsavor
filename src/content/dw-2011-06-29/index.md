_I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth. So then neither is he who plants nor he who waters anything, but God who causes to grow. â€” First Corinthians 3:6-7_ Paul realized the preciousness of his ministry, yet he honored the ministries of others because he knew only God could give the growth (1 Cor. 3:6-7). Few who serve the Lord ever gain this realization. Paul was clear that to divisively declare that they were of one servant or another was something of the flesh. He was clear enough to say that not only was he nothing, but Apollos also was nothing, for God was the one who caused the believers to grow.

I am thankful that I have been able to labor among you, but any growth cannot be attributed to me or to any other servant of the Lord, for it is God alone who causes the growth. Therefore we are for Christ alone. If we see this, we will not make such issues in the church life. Our oneness is of Christ alone. Take away Christ, and there is no oneness.
