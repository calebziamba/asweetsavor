> _“Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are differences of operation, but it is the same God who operates all things in all.”_
> 
> _(1 Corinthians 12:4-6)_

When the Spirit comes in, everyone becomes gifted. No one should say: I'm not gifted. Even if you can say, I'm not gifted, that _proves_ you are gifted. Everyone's gifted! Everyone receives a gift from the Lord. And maybe even more than one gift from the Lord. Everyone, when they are born again, they become gifted.
