_“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.” — Joshua 1:2-3_ The basic thought of wrestling against the rulers of this world is that we walk. God would tell us, just as He told Joshua, “Go over this Jordan....Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you” (Josh. 1:2-3). Only God can make that promise. The world tries its best to buy people, but it doesn’t have much to offer. Your company may promise to promote you. God, however, offers us Christ!
