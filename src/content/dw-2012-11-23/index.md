_Then it came about afterwards that David inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" And the Lord said to him, "Go up." So David said, "Where shall I go up?" And He said, "To Hebron."_ _— Second Samuel 2:1_

Though David had a strong army of six hundred men, he still asked the Lord, “Shall I go?” It seemed everything was clear outwardly, but he still wanted a word from the Lord to begin his rule. He then had the further confirmation from the response of the people: the men of Judah made him their king (2 Sam. 2:4).
