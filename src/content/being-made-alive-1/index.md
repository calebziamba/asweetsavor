> _But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)_
> 
> \- Ephesians 2:14-15, NASB

When you are made alive unto yourself you feel, “I am so terrible.” What happens then? "Lord, thank you. You are a Savior. Your blood cleanses me from all my sins. I’m made alive. And more than that, I’m a child of God. ... I have Christ in me as life. I begin to realize, I have value."
