_“Indeed, our couch is green.” — Song of Songs 1:16b_ Brothers and sisters, I am afraid that for many of us, our bed is rarely green. If we love the Lord and truly consecrate ourselves to the Lord we will say, “Lord, thank You that my couch is green.”

Although I have followed the Lord for several years, I never feel that my labor and service are sufficient. I never have the feeling I have accomplished much. My feeling is, “Lord, after so many years, why do I still feel like I am just beginning to love You?” It seems that after many years, there is still so much for me to experience. We can’t rest just because we have accomplished some laboring, preaching, or learning. There will always be so much more for us to experience. We should always be able to say, “Our couch is green.” That means we are full of life.
