_Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death._ _– Genesis 24:67_

This is the way of blessing. God had a plan and commissioned the Spirit. The Holy Spirit testifies and attracts us until we follow Him to the Lord. Praise the Lord! We will be brought into the glory of God and into complete union with the Lord. We will have the union of love in eternity, and the Lord will be comforted.
