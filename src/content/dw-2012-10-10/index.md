_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

Many times we consider that to serve the Lord, we must work in the same way as if we had taken a worldly job or career. Suppose you are a very bright person, you are knowledgeable in a certain field, and you are also a hard worker. When you choose a career, these characteristics will combine to help you succeed. When your person, your knowledge, and your energy work together, you will produce something in your field, and eventually you will become successful in your career.

Unfortunately, many times we bring this same mentality directly into the Lord’s recovery. When a young brother in the recovery desires to serve the Lord, he may declare, “Lord, I’m here! Look at me!” The brother thinks the Lord is so blessed because he loves Him. This brother is bright, charming, and capable, and now he is willing to serve the Lord. Isn’t that a blessing to God?

However, this brother is operating according to the principle of the world. With every career, and with every field, your talent, ability, and energy are useful; only when it comes to serving the Lord is the principle of service different. In fact, serving the Lord is totally different from everything else on this earth.
