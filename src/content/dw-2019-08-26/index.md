_“We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.” – Song of Songs 1:11, ASV_

God wants to separate His “mare among Pharaoh’s chariots” from the world by making you studs of silver. God wants you to pass through the experience of His redemption and to gain redemption through grace. At this time you may be attached to the world, signified by “Pharaoh’s chariots,” due to your weakness, but He will save you gradually until you are completely separated from the world. Thus the Lord will both constitute His life into you for His divine, golden expression and also work on you by the cross in order that you might experience His redemption. In this way, He will eventually make you a part of His beloved bride who is able to really match Him.
