_“Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight. Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.” — Ruth 3:2-3_

After all her preparations, Ruth had to go down to the threshing floor. From this point, her experience would be in darkness, in the night. We might have expected that, as a Christian following the Lord, we would be in the enjoyment all the time. Actually, from the time we gave ourselves to the Lord in this way, we began to enter into death, suffering, misunderstanding, defamation, and difficulties. This happens because of our desire to follow the Lord and Him alone.
