> ...that I may gain Christ and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8b-9

Paul doesnâ€™t say that to be found in Christ means not to be found in the material, religious, or sinful world. According to Paul, we can be found in Christ even though we are terrible. He says his aim was to be found in Him, not having any righteousness of his own.
