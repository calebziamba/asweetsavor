_Now the Lord said to Abram,_ _“Go forth from your country,_ _And from your relatives_ _And from your father’s house,_ _To the land which I will show you;_ _And I will make you a great nation,_ _And I will bless you,_ _And make your name great;_ _And so you shall be a blessing;_ _And I will bless those who bless you,_ _And the one who curses you I will curse._ _And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”_ _–  Genesis 12:1-3_

God’s will is that He become our good land, the inheritance of the called ones (Col. 1:12). His will is that He reign over us, the fellow citizens of a holy nation (Eph. 2:19; 1 Pet. 2:9). And His will is that through us, His called ones, He would fulfill His purpose to bless all the families of the earth.
