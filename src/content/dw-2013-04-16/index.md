Romans is a precious book. Someone once said that if the New Testament is a ring, then Romans is the diamond on that ring. Romans is written from God’s point of view concerning the gospel of God (1:1). This book unveils who God is, what He desires, and His plan for accomplishing it. This includes the process of our salvation: first we are condemned (chapters 1–3), then we are justified (chapters 3–5) and sanctified (chapters 5–8), until eventually we are glorified (chapter 8). All of these riches are in Romans.
