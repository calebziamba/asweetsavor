When we first love the Lord and give ourselves to Him, we often find ourselves in victory. When I first believed in Jesus and told others they also had to believe, they would agree with me and pray to receive the Lord. Today, if I tell people they need to believe in Jesus, they ask me to leave them alone. When I was eighteen, I loved the Lord like a young Joshua. I could tell the Lord, “I will fight!” But today many tell Him, “You want me to fight? I’ll think about it.”

How I wish I could intervene in the thought process that causes people to draw back! Without commitment, there is no way a person can follow the Lord. As soldiers, we must have the attitude that we are willing to be placed at the forefront of the battle.
