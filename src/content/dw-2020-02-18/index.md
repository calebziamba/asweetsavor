_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

Those whom Paul called dogs he also called evil workers. These evil workers were not committing obviously sinful or rebellious deeds. Such actions would not have caused as much damage to those in the church because everyone would have recognized them as evil. Instead, they presented essentially worthless things to the believers in a way that cheated them.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 180.
