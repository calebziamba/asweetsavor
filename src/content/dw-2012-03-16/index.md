_Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole Body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. — Colossians 2:18-19_

Our behavior as Christians is very interesting. When we see another believer, we are always happy, because we both have Christ. After discovering that each is a believer, however, the second topic that sometimes is raised often brings in division instead of oneness. Instead of asking about one’s experience of Christ, the question arises as to which church he attends. Immediately Christ as the source of oneness is lost, and the sweetness of meeting another believer disappears.
