The Bible tells us that Jacob “became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys” (Gen. 30:43). Jacob had run away from home and used his natural ability to become rich at Laban’s expense. He knew God but didn’t trust in Him. He was far from God. Yet when he used his natural ability to gain his wealth, God blessed him.

At this point, “Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, ‘Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.’ Jacob saw the attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not friendly toward him as formerly. Then the Lord said to Jacob, ‘Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you....I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth’” (31:1–3, 13). While Jacob was enjoying all his riches, God spoke to him to bring him back to the Promised Land. Jacob now realized that while he might forget about God, God would never forget him. When God appeared to him, he knew his wealth was vain and that only God and His purpose were valuable. God would never forget the vow he made before Him at Bethel.

Once God begins to work on us, He will never quit (Phil. 1:6). We may think that when God deals with us, He would always scourge us, punish us, and strip us. No. God is much greater. He often allows us to gain what we desire. But when we get what we want, He shows us that all our natural desires are vain. What we really need is to be brought into His eternal will.
