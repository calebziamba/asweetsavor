When the world comes to us, we must be conscious of its operation. Everything in the world operates to tempt us. The temptations we encounter are no different than those the people in the world encounter.

It is easy for young people to say, “I am willing to eat tree roots and drink water from the mountain.” This is not an easy thing to say, however, when we have a family with children. We should learn from the pattern presented to us by the Lord’s servant. We must cultivate and equip our heart continually.
