_The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown._ _– Genesis 6:2, 4_

We must aspire to be so pure that the focus of our service is only the Lord and His will. Otherwise, we will become like the sons of God who married the daughters of men and produced the mighty men of renown. This result seemed good, but God condemned it, saying that man was flesh, and “every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually” (Gen. 6:5). Not only would the Spirit of God not strive with man, but man would be destroyed from the face of the earth (Gen. 6:3, 5, 7).
