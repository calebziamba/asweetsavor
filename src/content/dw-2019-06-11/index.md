_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

When we became Christians, at first we felt free to be self-centered and walked where we wished. But from the day we began to love the Lord and consecrated ourselves to Him, we began to fear God.

No one can be taught to fear God, for the fear of God comes from one’s love for Him. The more we love Him, the more we fear to offend Him or do wrong before Him. This authority He has over us comes from His love.
