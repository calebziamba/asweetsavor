_And when He had deposed Saul, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will. â€” Acts 13:22_

We may consider how to please our parents, spouse, or others. There may be many people we try to please more than the Lord. Actually, the person we want to please the most is ourselves. It seems we have many bosses. Even in spiritual matters, we may consider what we do in light of others, not the Lord. A spiritual person, however, considers what is profitable to the Lord, trusting other people to Him.
