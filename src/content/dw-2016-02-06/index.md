_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... â€”Philippians 2:1_

Few realize that if we really want to serve others, we need a proper humanity. Many feel so able to reveal Christ and His purpose, yet they lack the humanity that makes them accessible to others. They feel like heroes in their visitations, yet what others really need, they lack. If we are without affection and compassion, we will only be able to give others doctrines and teachings. We need to learn to come to others as their fellows, in lowliness and meekness, as our Lord Jesus did.
