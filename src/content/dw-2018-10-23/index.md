Paul did not become bitter due to the things he suffered but instead experienced Christ in them. He recognized God’s sovereign arrangement as he passed through hardship after hardship, believing that the Lord was with him.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 146.
