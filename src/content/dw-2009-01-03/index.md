_But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God. — Acts 20:24_ You must have a spirit willing to do whatever is required for the benefit of the Lord's recovery. ((The term "the Lord's recovery" refers here to the work the Lord has been doing throughout the ages to bring man back to His original intention, i.e., to gain an expression of Himself. In the church age this work of recovery has been carried out in different aspects through servants of the Lord such as Martin Luther, Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren, John Darby and the Plymouth Brethren, and more recently through Watchman Nee and Witness Lee.)) You should not care about the price you have to pay for the blessing of the church. If you have this kind of spirit, you will never be disappointed or lose heart no matter how people might talk about you. People may say that you are ambitious, “dead,” or evil. You will not care what they say if you are one who is willing to do all for the benefit of the Lord's recovery.

A “wise” person would never follow the Lord while being aware of what might happen. Such “smart” ones know that if they get into certain situations, it will mean trouble. They realize that if they say a certain thing, there will be repercussions.

The one who follows the Lord, however, cannot be so wise; he must follow the Lord foolishly. He must have the spirit that only cares for the profit of the Lord's recovery. What I say, what I do, what I prophesy—all must be for the benefit of the Lord's recovery. We need the Lord's mercy to grant us wisdom, and we must tell the Lord, “Lord, I consecrate myself to You, and I am willing to pay any price that Your recovery might be blessed."
