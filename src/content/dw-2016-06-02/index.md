The very first item in our new position as believers in Christ is that we are no longer condemned. Our old position was indeed one of condemnation, but in our new position we are free from condemnation. John 3:18 (ESV) tells us that those who do not believe are already condemned, but this verse also says,

_Whoever believes in Him is not condemned._

And Romans 8:1 tells us,

_There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus._
