__You must be born again.‚Äù  
\-John 3:7__

What did the Lord mean when He spoke the words above? To be born again with the life of Christ is the greatest blessing any human being can ever receive, but it is also a great mystery.

_Born Again: Our New Life in Christ_, by Titus Chu, makes an excellent Bible study tool for exploring the topic of our new birth, because it simply goes through the scriptures to cover, point-by-point, a number of the crucial and wonderful things that happen to us the moment we believe in Jesus Christ.
