_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

Because Paul and Epaphroditus shared the same divine life, Paul spoke of him as his brother (Phil. 2:25). Paul went on to call him his fellow worker, not because he could get many people saved or was so capable, but because they had the same vision and commitment. Epaproditus was also Paulâ€™s fellow soldier, for he struggled and fought alongside Paul for the kingdom of the Lord.
