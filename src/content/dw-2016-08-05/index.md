When people touch the Lord, their personality is transformed and their reaction to things changes. They begin to fear God and to respect the leading brothers, the church, and the Word of God. They also begin to form a good personality that can be of use to God. This is the first step of Godâ€™s work in their personality as a result of transformation.
