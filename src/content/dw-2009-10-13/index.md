_Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are. — John 17:11b_

_That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. — John 17:21_

When we were born again, we were born into the Body of Christ. So what should we do? We should learn to be before the Lord and enjoy His life and grace. Then we should love one another. We should impart life to one another and pour ourselves out upon one another.

In such a love, we must endeavor to keep the oneness. We should not fight for practices. We should not argue about doctrines. These are not important. What we need is to be one. Among us there should be such a treasure: that we love each other and that we are one. We shouldn't care about anything else. We should only care for the love of one another and for the oneness of the Body of Christ.
