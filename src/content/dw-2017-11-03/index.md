_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

In the church life, our grumbling and disputing is directed at three targets: God, those leading the church, and the conditions and situations in our environment. We complain to God, saying, “Why me?” He might answer, “Why not you?” As for the church leaders, we are often critical of their decisions and even their personalities. We may feel they are not giving us the recognition or responsibility we deserve.
