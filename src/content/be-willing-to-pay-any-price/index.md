> _Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.”_
> 
> \- Matt. 2:1–2

This response shows what makes these wise men special....They were real seekers, seeking after the reality of human existence and after the reality of the universe's existence. In that seeking, they had a profound pursuit of the meaning of the universe. They didn't just see something; they paid a price. They wanted to pay a price to get the reality. This is why they really were wise men. They were willing to pay whatever the price was in order to gain the truth of what they had seen. We can imagine them declaring to one another, "Now, I see the star! Whatever price there is to pay, I want to pay it! Let's go!"
