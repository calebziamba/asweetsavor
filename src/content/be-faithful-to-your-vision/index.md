_"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.”” Matthew 2:1-2 NASB_

You do have a vision. If you didn’t have a vision, then how could you be in the church life? But let me ask, does the vision feel more and more remote, or has it become closer and closer? If it becomes more and more distant, more and more remote, that means you saw something, but you have failed it. You didn’t pay a price for the vision you see. But, by the Lord’s mercy, many Christians can testify: because they are faithful to the vision they see, the vision becomes closer. The vision becomes more clear. The vision becomes more realistic. The vision becomes more applicable. The vision becomes part of their life. Their living and pursuing becomes one with their vision. This is exactly what’s mentioned here. The star “went before them.” Why? Because they had faithfully pursued it.
