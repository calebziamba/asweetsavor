_He makes me lie down in green pastures;_ _He leads me beside quiet waters...._ _Even though I walk through_ _   the valley of the shadow of death,_ _I fear no evil, for You are with me;_ _Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me._ _– Psalm 23:2,4_

We expect God will always lead us into outward blessings. However, He leads us into both green pastures and the valley of the shadow of death (Psa. 23:2, 4). No matter where He leads, His intent is that we would find Him, know Him, and experience Him.
