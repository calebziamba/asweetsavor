_And he said, “Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.”_ _–  Acts 7:2_

Our Christian service can be like unbelievers doing business. We should not serve like teachers taking care of students or employers managing employees. It is not a matter of what we do in our serving or how we stir everyone up. We should ask ourselves, “Do I have the Lord’s appearing in my serving?” We cannot go on without His appearing.
