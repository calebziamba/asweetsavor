_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

What kind of life does the Lord want us to have? He desires that we have a life of the song of songs. Although in these eight chapters the Shulammite experiences failure and weakness, these experiences all occur, under His sovereignty, as a part of this song.

The Lord desires that we would always be able to tell others, “I have the song of songs. My Lord is the best. My Lord is the fairest. He is all and in all. My serving is according to the Lord I love. My prayer and labor are according to the Lord I love. My life and breath are according to the Lord I love. Today everything I have is according to the Lord I love.” Such a person is one who lives in the reality of the song of songs.
