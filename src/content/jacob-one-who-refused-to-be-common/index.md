The "hammered" or "beaten" nature of the Golden Lampstand shows we must submit to the Lord's dealing with us in order to grow in Christ. Here, brother Titus Chu considers the life of Jacob as one who refused to be common, allowing the Lord to work on him throughout his life. When the Bible tells us that God touched Jacob's thigh, the word used for thigh is the same as that used in describing the base of the lampstand. This shows us that we must allow God to touch the very base of our living if we are to truly follow the Lord.

This excerpt is taken from the July 2016 Summer Vision Week training in Cleveland, OH. This training was focused on the Golden Lampstand of the Tabernacle, as described in Exodus chapter 25.
