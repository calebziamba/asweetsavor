_For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me. — Philippians 1:6-7_

Let me give you an example. Once I walked into a place and discovered a book table, upon which was a book by G. Campbell Morgan, translated into Chinese. What interested me was the name of the person who was the translator, for it turned out he was a brother I had known while in Taipei. We both loved the Lord, but he eventually left the recovery, and hence he did not participate in the riches and the grace that Witness Lee released over the last 40 years.

That brother remained a very good brother, but what he produced was a translation of a somewhat dated book. I appreciate his translation, but I tell you, brothers, I am so thankful that for more than 40 years I have been closely attached to Brother Lee. Thus, the grace that Brother Lee received, I also have partaken of.

When he ministered on the four stages of life, I partook of that grace. When he ministered on the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit, I partook of that grace. When he ministered on pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord, I partook of that grace. When he ministered on one city, one church, I was a partaker of that grace. When Brother Lee shared his Life-study of the Bible, I was a partaker of that grace. When he shared on the new way and the divine and mystical realm, I also partook with him of that grace. Brothers and sisters, I have participated in so many riches of grace simply because I had the apostle in my heart.
