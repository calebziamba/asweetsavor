_For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled. — Romans 5:10_ Formerly all the saints without exception were sinners. Yet now all the saints must experience the organic salvation with the divine life. We were all once enemies of God. Now, however, not only are we reconciled, but we are also being saved in His life (Rom. 5:10), and this life is the gift (“charisma”) of God (Rom. 6:23). All the saints, enjoying the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness, reign in life through the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:17).

I am saved in His life; I reign in His life. All the saints, having been buried with Him through baptism into His death, are now walking in newness of life (Rom. 6:4). All the saints consecrate themselves as slaves of righteousness unto sanctification (Rom. 6:19). Sanctification refers to a process. All the saints who are enjoying the law of the Spirit of life are set free to walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:2, 4). They have life and peace not only in themselves but also in the church life, thus producing the reality of oneness and one accord.

Only when we are able to walk according to spirit can there be one accord. One accord comes from our walking in spirit. All the saints are heirs of God and thus joint heirs with Christ, that they may all be glorified with Him together (Rom. 8:17).
