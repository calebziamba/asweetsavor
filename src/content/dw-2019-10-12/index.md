_he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me. - Philippians 2:30_

The Philippians desired to care for Paul, who had raised up that church, but for some reason there was a lack in their care (Phil. 2:30). They were concerned enough, however, to send Epaphroditus. Upon his arrival, Epaphroditus saw the need and set about working to fill up the Philippians’ lack of service toward Paul. I really like this portion of the Bible because it portrays the reality and practicality of the church life. We are not for the work. We are for the organic body of Christ. In this organic body, our relationship should be like the relationship between the apostle Paul, the church in Philippi, Timothy, and Epaphroditus. Praise the Lord for this wonderful organic body!
