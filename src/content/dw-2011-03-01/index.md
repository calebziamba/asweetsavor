_"As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters." — Song of Songs 2:2_ Thorns are a result of God’s curse upon man when he fell. God told Adam and Eve after they had fallen, “Thorns and thistles it \[the earth\] will bring forth for you” (Gen. 3:18).

The mention of thorns in this verse in Solomon’s song reveals that although we are sanctified and trust in the Lord, we still walk among fallen mankind. Many people around us are just like thorns, and in our fallen condition, we are at times thorns to others as well. As long as we are living in the midst of man’s fallen nature, many situations will try us and even attempt to pierce us. But such situations should manifest that we are lilies.
