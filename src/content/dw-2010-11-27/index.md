_I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. —Romans 12:1_ To follow the Lord is not a religion. Paul says, “My desire is that you become a living sacrifice.” To be a living sacrifice is not easy. Only when you serve by being burned and consumed is it a reasonable service.
