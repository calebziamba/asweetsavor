We like to use a brother when he begins to love the Lord and to have some desire. Our tradition is to use anyone who is desirous. Once I strongly told some brothers, “No. You cannot use those who are desirous, for when you use them, you damage them.” Why did I say this? We employ human methods when we use others, and those we use will unwittingly be ruined, for the work will become to them a religious work.
