> _So it was, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him by the name of his father, Zacharias. His mother answered and said, “No; he shall be called John.”_
> 
> \- Luke 1:59-60

These two verses paint a very clear picture of how we can fall into the pattern of tradition in our Christian life. We are Zacharias, so anyone we beget should also be called Zacharias. We go to church every Sunday, so anyone we save should also go to church on Sundays. This may not necessarily be wrong, but it is not enough. The name “John” was revealed to Elizabeth through the grace of God. In the same way we need to see something new from the Lord. When someone is saved, you have to ask yourself, who is caring for their spiritual food? Are they being supplied with what they need? Just because they go to Sunday meetings every week does not necessarily mean they are nourished and have received what they need. Through God’s grace, we need Him to reveal to us how to be with new ones, care for them, and properly raise them up. How can you care for someone outside of the Sunday meeting this week?
