_Now the Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. When he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth._ _– Genesis 18:1-2_

Genesis 18 tells us a precious story that is related Abraham’s nephew Lot. At that time Lot lived in Sodom, the city of sin. The Lord and two of His angels appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre (vv. 1–2). When Abraham saw them, he invited them to rest and prepared food for them. The two angels left, but Abraham continued to stand before God.
