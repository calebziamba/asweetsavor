_Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh._ _– Ezekiel 36:26_

_\[You are\] being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts._ _– 2 Corinthians 3:3_

Ezekiel 36:26 shows us that when we were born again, our stony heart was replaced with a heart of flesh. Then, in 2 Corinthians 3:3, we see that, after being born again, we experience the Lord writing on our hearts with the Spirit of the living God.
