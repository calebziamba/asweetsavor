_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _â€” Philippians 1:2_

Grace and peace are great matters. Throughout our entire Christian life, we will be tested by these. Do we really have the enjoyment of the many rich aspects of the living Christ as grace? If so, the issue will be peace, both inwardly and outwardly. Inwardly, we will have peace related to our stand before the Lord. Outwardly, we will have peace related to our environment.
