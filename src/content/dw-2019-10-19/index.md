_But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need - Philippians 2:25_

Although Epaphroditus was commissioned by the church in Philippi to carry out a practical service, he handled it in a priestly way. He had grown from being only a common brother to being a minister. As such, he became much more than Paul’s “ATM”—he ministered to Paul’s spiritual need. What an experience of growth! To attain a ministry like this, we must pass through a process of growth.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 174.
