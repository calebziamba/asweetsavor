_“May you be blessed, my son David! You shall both do great things and also still prevail.” — First Samuel 26:25_ David told Saul that he was driving him from the land of the Lord’s inheritance to dwell in the lands of false gods. Yet he didn’t blame Saul directly. He said simply, “If the Lord has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, may they be cursed before the Lord” (1 Sam. 26:19). Once again, Saul was very moved by David’s actions. Twice he had Saul at his mercy, and twice he let Saul go. Saul said, “May you be blessed, my son David! You shall both do great things and also still prevail” (v. 25).

Was it finally over? It was not. Saul was caught up in something he no longer could control. Church history demonstrates how impossible it is for those caught with ideology and religion to stop until they have carried out their intention. For instance, in the history of the Plymouth Brethren in England, none were more faithful to John Darby than William Kelly, yet the followers of Darby eventually drove even Kelly out. When religion becomes ideology and ideology replaces Christ, people will do everything in their power to preserve that ideology. Once someone is caught in an ideology, Christ no longer seems to count.
