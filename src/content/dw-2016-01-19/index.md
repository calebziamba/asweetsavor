_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... â€”Philippians 2:1_

Only when our person and our words are one will the consolation we supply be genuine and effective. We have all experienced two kinds of consolation. Some people try to console merely with words, while others have their person invested. They do not come to us just to carry out the job of consoling. Their heart is with us and remains with us even after they leave.
