_\[You are\] being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts._ _– 2 Corinthians 3:3_

May the Lord be merciful to us. Every day we should say, “Lord, today I want You to write something on my heart.” Our experience of the Lord is His writing on our hearts, making our letters a little longer. If we have experienced the Lord today, that means something has been written on us. Every time the Spirit moves within us and we cooperate with Him, it means the Lord is writing upon us.

We need to allow the Lord to write on us throughout our entire life. Otherwise, we will surely regret the lost opportunities. May we all allow the Lord to write on us day by day throughout our lives so that we become long and substantial letters of Christ!
