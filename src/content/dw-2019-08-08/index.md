_“And pasture your young goats_ _By the tents of the shepherds.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:8_

Those who begin to follow the Lord should pursue the growth in life personally on the one hand, and on the other hand they should also know the footsteps of the flock. The footsteps of the flock grant us confidence that our labor is of the Lord. The Lord has not called us to follow Him on our own, and He will not ask us to leave the rich supply in the church. Even when we have some “young goats” to take care of, we need to pasture them by the shepherds’ tents.
