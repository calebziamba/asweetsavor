_Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?_ _– First Corinthians 1:13_

As Paul described in 1 Corinthians, after being saved, we quickly discover how messy the church life is. For example, in Corinth there were people declaring, “I am of Paul,” “I am of Cephas,” and “I am of Apollos” (1:12). We should never belong to anyone except Christ Himself. We are only for Christ.

Paul was strong in his response—”Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he?” (1:13); “All things belong to you, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas” (3:21–22). We don’t belong to them; they belong to us.
