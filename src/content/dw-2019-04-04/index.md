_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus.  
– Philippians 1:1  
  
But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father._  
_– Philippians 2:22_

The Lord works with each of His children and causes them to grow one by one. He enjoys them and causes them to love Him one by one. He joyfully declares, “Behold, I and the children whom God has given Me” (Heb. 2:13). That is a labor with commitment.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")
