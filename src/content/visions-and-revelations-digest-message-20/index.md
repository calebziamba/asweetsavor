## **The Life of One Who Has Visions and Revelations**

After having visions and revelations, what kind of life should you have? Should it be buoyant and prevailing? A life on a different plane, untouched by normal problems? That’s not how it was with the apostle Peter. Peter, despite his high visions and revelations, still had his limitations and weaknesses. So what kind of life did he have? And what kind of life should we have?

Peter’s life can be our example. When he was young, he lived one way, and when he was old he lived another way. But throughout his life, he was girded. He denied his soul-life. He lived focusing on Christ alone. This is the life every Christian should live.

### **When** Y**ou are Young**

_Most assuredly, I say to you,_ **_when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished_**_; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish._  
\- _John 21:18_

> The Lord distinguished a period of Peter’s life as “when you were younger.” Every Christian—including us!—should have a stage of life when we are young, when we are bold and committed to walk, labor, and live according to what we feel the Lord has told each one of us individually.

With every Christian, there should be a stage, "I see something, I want to exercise, I'd like to fulfill what the Lord has committed to me."

> So you can see the apostle Peter had a very romantic life. The goal of his life was very clear: “I’m going to serve the Lord according to what the Lord has shown me. I see a vision, I see visions, I see revelations, praise the Lord. In my life, I'm very free. I'm a servant of the Lord. I go where I feel the Lord leads me. I minister however I feel the Lord wants me to minister. I'm with people because I feel the Lord wants me to be with these people.” You know, brothers, if you ask me, I would say that this is the most romantic life a man could have. I see something. I see the meaning of life, the substance of life. I see the reality of life. I see why a Christian is born and saved and why he receives visions and revelations. Marvelous! Therefore I am a servant of the Lord.”

### **When You are Old**

_Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished;_ **_but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish._**  
_John 21:18_

> But anyways, Peter eventually grows old. The Lord's prediction is when you become old, you will stretch out your hands. What does this mean? Willingly. Maybe willingly by force. “I know I have no choice.” Maybe willingly because I just feel that's what I have to do. I stretch out my hands and let others bind me. I'm bound to the place I don't want.
> 
> Today there’s no Roman empire. Today there's no cross for us to die on. Today it's very simple. When we become mature, we live a life under a kind of bondage. We willingly live a life under that kind of bondage. Who binds us? The Lord binds us, the church binds us, the needs of the church bind us, brothers and sisters bind us, those who love the Lord bind us, those who don't love the Lord bind us.

> [\- Message Transcript, p. 2](http://english.thechurchincleveland.org/uploads/3/6/7/5/3675146/message_20_edit.pdf)

> When you are young, you should have the feeling, “Go! Go! Let’s go preach the gospel! Raise up testimonies! Fight for the vision we have received!” But when you are old, you realize that all kinds of needs are there. It’s no longer about how you feel, but about the need you see. This is a good kind of bondage. You see a need in the church, so you have to live according to that need. You see a need in the saints, so you live according to that need. Your concern is _What is best for the Lord_, rather than, _What I am burdened for._

\[There is\] so much need among many churches, so much need with so many brothers and sisters. Now they become my binding force. I have to live for them.

### **Denying Yourself**

_But He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.” Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his \[soul\] life will lose it, but whoever loses his \[soul\] life for My sake will find it._  
_Matthew 16:23-25_

> Another aspect of the life of someone who has seen a vision is to learn how to handle their soul life. “If you lose your soul life, you will gain your soul life.” This can be a peculiar or confusing statement, but the key is realizing that our soul can become different. Although we always love the Lord with our souls, we initially do so from our natural, mixed souls. But as we continue to walk with and grow in the Lord, He transforms us.

> This process is one of forsaking your soul — even denying your soul. Whatever you like? No, not if it’s not according to Christ. Whatever you appreciate? No, not if it’s not according to Christ. Even the best desire for Christ, such as when Peter held Jesus and said, “No this will never happen to you!” No! The Lord says, “this is Satan. Get behind me.” You must deny your soul life to get a better soul life. The transformed soul life. The purified soul life. The crystallized soul life. A life that’s so clear before God and before the Lord.

### **Christ Alone**

_And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!”_   
_Matthew 17:3–5_

> Peter had to be tested here. Peter’s thought was, “I see three men in the glory. I see Jesus, I see Moses, and I see Elijah.” He didn’t realize there was only one glory, the glory coming from Jesus Christ, the Son of God, covering Moses and covering Elijah. They joined in to that glory. So he began to say, “Well, I want to follow the Lord. Praise the Lord, this is so marvelous. I will get three tents, one for You, Jesus, because You will always be the first, but also one for Moses and one for Elijah.” Brothers, do you realize what this is? Whether young or old, when you follow the Lord, your life will be like Peter. When you follow the Lord, you will have to go through the process to deny your soul life and follow Him, so your soul can be transformed. And more than that, you have to be brought out of religion. What is religion? “Isn’t that marvelous? Christ is glorious! But here’s Moses, if I can do this I’ll be okay. And here is Elijah, if I can preach like this, I’ll be okay.” 
> 
> Then God said, “This is My beloved Son. In Him I am delighted.” You know, brothers, many things we say, “Lord, may we please You.” God would answer, “I am happy you do this. But you know, I delight in only one person: Jesus Christ. The One who makes Me happy is only Jesus Christ. You must gain Christ.”

### **Concluding Word**

> When you see a vision, three things will be your life.
> 
> Firstly, I really appreciate it. Can we all say: I am girded! I want to go out! I want to preach the gospel! I don’t care if this is so spiritual, but I’m burdened, I’m really burdened. Brothers, this is a blessing. When I become mature, then I am under a kind of limitation from the church, from the saints, and from the environment. But when I am young, I would like to go out and testify Christ! I would like to pioneer for the Lord’s testimony!
> 
> Secondly, I want to deny my soul life, so I can gain a soul life that is clear, that is crystal, that is pure, that is only concerned with Christ Himself, which is to bring a profit to Christ.
> 
> Thirdly, I don’t want to be in religion. When I follow the Lord, I appreciate Moses and I appreciate Elijah. I appreciate men of God, I appreciate the servants who speak God’s word and open it to us, who help us, who raise us up, but even then, I know: who do I follow? Christ! Who’s my Lord? Christ! Who’s the center of my living? Christ! You have a vision? You need to have a life of nothing but Christ. May the Lord be merciful to us.

### Concluding Hymn: Be Thou Supreme

1. Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,  
    Nor creed, nor form, nor word,  
    Nor holy Church, nor human love,  
    Compare with Thee, my Lord!
2. Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,  
    Thy love has conquered me;  
    Beneath Thy Cross I die to self,  
    And live alone to Thee.
3. Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,  
    My inmost being fill;  
    So shall I think as Thou dost think,  
    And will as Thou dost will.
4. Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,  
    Thy life transfigure mine;  
    And through this veil of mortal flesh,  
    Lord, let Thy splendor shine.
5. Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,  
    My soul exults in Thee;  
    To be Thy slave, to do Thy will,  
    Is my felicity.
