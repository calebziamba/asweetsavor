_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

Grumbling comes from our emotions. Disputing involves the logical exercise of our mind. Paul said emphatically that we should do all things without grumbling or disputing.
