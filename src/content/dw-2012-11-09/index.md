"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."  
— John 12:24_

_To Timothy, my genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord._  
_— First Timothy 1:2_

_“Behold, I and the children whom God has given to Me.”_  
_— Hebrews 2:13b_

How precious it is to die and bear much fruit! That is to beget sons, and that is to bear fruit in life. Remember what the book of Hebrews says: “Behold, I and the children whom God has given to Me” (Heb. 2:13b).

We must enjoy such a verse. It is a universal declaration from the very Christ. The Lord fell into the ground to die, expecting to bear much fruit. Then in resurrection He declared, “Behold, I and the children whom God has given to Me!” Now all of us have been brought forth as His fruit. All the Christians are the Lord’s children. We are the sons of God. So when we desire to serve the Lord, we must tell the Lord, “Lord, I do not want to manufacture something. I want to beget. I want to bear fruit in life.”
