Sisters should learn not to be “spiritual.” A church that has many “spiritual” sisters is in trouble. The fewer such sisters there are, the better.

However, this does not mean we should not be in spirit. Nor does it mean that we should be in our flesh. Often the sisters aim at the wrong thing. We want to be spiritual so that we can be a certain kind of sister in the church life, but that is not right. In all my years in the church life, I have never seen an exalted, spiritual sister end up being healthy. Once you are “spiritual” you become opinionated. It becomes easy for you to tell others the “right way” to do things. The best way for us to see the church life is to first see that we do not have to be spiritual.
