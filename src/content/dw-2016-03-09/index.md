_The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown._ _– Genesis 6:2, 4_

When they are young, many Christians desire to become great teachers or evangelists to gain the praise and appreciation of others. Because they are not pure, they use all their own ideas and skills to accomplish what they think is God’s plan for them. At some point they realize that this plan is not going to be fulfilled. The disappointment that follows causes them to give up all service and take a back seat or even leave the church altogether. Only those who are pure and without mixture can stay healthy.
