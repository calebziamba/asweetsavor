> ...that I may gain Christ and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith
> 
> \- Philippians 3:8b-9

Are we in spirit all the time? Do we constantly read the Bible? Are we overcoming every hour? Are we continually considering the profit of others and praying for them? To all this, we would have to say, “No.” Then how can we say we are found in Christ? We can because, even as we are defeated, we still believe in what Christ has accomplished for us. We believe Christ is our Savior. We believe that we are being carried by Him. This is the faith on which our righteousness is based, and it is because of this righteousness that we are found in Him.
