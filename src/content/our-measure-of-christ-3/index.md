> however, letâ€™s keep living by that same _standard_ to which we have attained.
> 
> \-- Philippians 3:17 NASB

The Christ we have gained becomes the ruling element in our daily life. This rule is a living person, and the more we possess Him, the more He will set Himself as a rule over us. According to our concept if we are under some rule, we cannot act freely, for restriction and freedom seem mutually exclusive. However, this rule is not only a boundary that restricts our walk. It also marks out a sphere in which we can freely walk because what the Lord has measured to us is so grand.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 231
