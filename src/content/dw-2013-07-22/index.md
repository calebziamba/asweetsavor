_Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ _— Philippians 1:2_

Whether we have money or not, whether we have good health or not, whether our situation is easy or difficult, smooth or rough—if we have sufficient grace, we have peace. Money, good health, or a smooth situation cannot bring such peace. We are at peace with our outward environment when we touch the Lord as grace and realize that His hand governs all things in our lives. All our problems, limitations, and weaknesses have been measured to us by God.
