_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _— Philippians 2:14–15_

Paul told us that in the midst of this crooked and perverse generation we should “appear as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15). Inwardly, we have the divine life as children of God; outwardly, we bear the divine testimony, appearing as lights in the world.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; pages 128-129.
