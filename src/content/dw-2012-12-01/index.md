_Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man’s work._ _— First Corinthians 3:12-13_

_For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad._ _— Second Corinthians 5:10_

May none of us simply live a Christian life or do a Christian work. We should not simply be zealous for something. We must have the Lord’s coming in view.

What have we done that will stand at the judgment seat? Watchman Nee wrote a hymn with this thought. Daily, he said, he sought to live his life in view of the judgment seat of Christ, that his work might be able to pass through the fire on that day. Paul told us that “the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is” (1 Cor. 3:13).
