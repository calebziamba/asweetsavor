_“Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. My beloved responded and said to me, ‘Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.’” — Song of Songs 2:8-10_

_Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. — Philippians 3:13-14_

The Lord allows us not only to see Him but also to hear Him, for He calls to us, saying, “Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away” (2:10).

Here the Lord praises His seeker and calls her His beauty. The Lord considers her beautiful and lovely. She is very attractive, so the Lord says, “Rise up, my love, my beauty, and come away.”
