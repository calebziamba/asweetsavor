There was a time when some young people reported to Brother Lee that I was considering going into some business. (I was considering it, for I felt it might relieve Brother Lee of some burden.) After hearing of this, Brother Lee called me and said, “Titus, in these years the Lord seems to be telling me not to have anything to do with business. As you know, Brother Nee was not successful in his attempt, and neither was I when I tried something. The Lord told me to give it up, and that He would provide everything for the work and for my needs. I now give you the same advice.”
