_Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.  So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there three years. The heart of King David longed to go out to Absalom. – Second Samuel 13:37-39a_

_Absalom came to the king and prostrated himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom._ _– Second Samuel 13:33b_

King David loved his son Absalom. The Bible says that from head to toe, Absalom had no blemish and had incredibly thick hair (2 Sam. 14:25–26). One day he killed one of his half-brothers for taking advantage of his sister. Afterward, he fled, and “David mourned for his son every day” and “longed to go to Absalom” (13:37, 39). After three years, Joab found a way to return Absalom to Jerusalem, even though David would not see him (2 Sam. 14). Eventually, however, David did receive him back.
