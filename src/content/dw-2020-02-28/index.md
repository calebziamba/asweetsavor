_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

When the result of everything that happens in the church life is that we are brought to Christ, the situation in the church is healthy. However, when the focus is something other than Christ Himself, we become sectarian.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 182.
