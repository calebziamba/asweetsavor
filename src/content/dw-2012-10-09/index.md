_"_Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."_ — John 12:24_

Every seed, when it is in the right place, is hidden. This does not mean that it is merely put aside; it means that it is buried and ready to die. If you are a seed in a certain place, then you are buried there. You are prepared to die so that your outward shell can be broken and the life inside of you can come out. This is the first secret which everyone who desires to serve the Lord must learn.

You must be saturated with this realization. “I am here as a seed. My future is just to die. My fate is just to die. I am to be hidden, and I am to go through the process of death and burial.” Everything else may be easy, but to be a seed in this way is very difficult for all of us.
