_“For why should I be like one who veils herself_ _Beside the flocks of your companions?”_ _– Song of Songs 1:7_

“Where is the right place for me? Where can I function?” Not until we experience the Spirit’s breaking will we realize that others are experiencing exactly the same thing that we are experiencing. Because we are so subjective and we do not see this, we only see our own situation. Therefore we are not able to cooperate with others or to receive the direction in the body of Christ.
