After Paul arrived at what seemed to be a peak in verse 12, he discovered it was a plateau instead of a peak. Once we arrive at such a high experience of Christ, we find unsearchable riches for us to abide in. It is not a peak that we must climb down from. No, it is an immense plateau for us to walk upon! No matter how spiritual or mature he was or how much he had gained of Christ, he realized that his pursuit was not over and that he had not yet arrived at his final goal.
