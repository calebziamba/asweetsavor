In addition to spiritual understanding, we must also equip ourselves to react spiritually in all situations. Spiritual understanding is something for your receiving, whereas spiritual reaction is something for your doing. For example, I may like one of my shirts very much, because it is comfortable. When I cannot find my favorite shirt, I need to have a proper understanding about why it has disappeared, and not blame my poor wife for losing it. This relates to our spiritual understanding.

Then what about my reaction? When I ask the Lord why my shirt is missing, a reaction should take place. I may begin to confess to the Lord, and say, “Lord, I am so foolish to love this shirt more than I love You. Please forgive me. There are still so many things I am fond of besides You.” You should not simply react naturally, and go buy another shirt. No! In everything you should have the appropriate spiritual reaction.
