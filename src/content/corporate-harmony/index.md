Those who love the Lord, pursue Him, and give themselves to Him know how to keep themselves in harmony with others. The secret to harmony is laying hold of Christ. If other things replace Christ as our focus, our harmony will disappear. We are here only to gain and possess Christ.This is what we must stand for. We must be willing to pay any price to lay hold of Christ. Otherwise, we will not experience true harmony.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, p. 257
