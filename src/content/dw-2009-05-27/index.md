_Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. — Ruth 2:1

_Many times a seemingly small occurrence can change our lives.

When we believe in the Lord, many such things begin to happen to us due to the Lord's governmental activity in our environment. The Lord arranges everything for our profit. We should not say, “What a lousy boss (or teacher or professor) I have!” Every detail in our lives has been tailored by God for us to know the Lord and to gain Him.

If we do not know how to appreciate what the Lord has done, we will not be able to enter fully into what the Lord has prepared for our benefit. If we appreciate the Lord's arrangement, many things in our experience will become steps of life. Without this realization, we will merely pass through things without gaining much profit from them.

Once we begin to follow the Lord, the first thing we must acknowledge is the Lord's divine arrangement of all things in our life. We will then say, “Lord, my life is in Your hands. My future is in Your hands. In all things, You are the One who is in control.”
