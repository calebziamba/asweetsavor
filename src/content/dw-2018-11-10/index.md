If we desire to be approved by testing, we must pay attention to our ability to shepherd. We must consider our labor. Whether or not we are approved by the Lord is seen in the fruit we produce and the effectiveness of our labor. We must be desperate about our effectiveness, for it proves who we are and where we are with the Lord. It is abnormal to labor for one or two years and have no fruit to show for it. We should be fruitful. Our approvedness is declared by the fruit of our labor.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 149.
