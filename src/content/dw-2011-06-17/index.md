_Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Psalm 132:1-5_

As we have seen, this prayer is to “the Mighty One of Jacob” (v. 2). In other words we pray, “Oh Lord, You are the mighty God of transformation! You are the mighty God of testimony! But where is the reality of Your habitation? Where is the substance of Your tabernacle? This is what I am fighting for! I am fighting to bring the whole church life into this reality!”
