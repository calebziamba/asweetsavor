_You shall march around the city, all you men of war; you shall go all around the city once. This you shall do six days. And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. But the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. — Joshua 6:3-4_

Satan is a very subtle enemy. He tells us how wonderful we are. Instead of “Hallelujah,” we begin to think, “Hallelu-me!” With one simple trick, he has caused us to leave our stand as members in the body and get swept away with sinful pride. We need to blow our trumpet of ram’s horn, declaring we are saved by the blood of the Lord. In this way, we gain the victory (Rev. 12:11).

When we fail, Satan will say, “How can the Lord love a sinner like you?” We don’t need to argue back but just be in the church life and march with the believers against Satan’s kingdom declaring, “Hallelujah, I am saved by the blood of the Lamb!” Then we have to tell Satan, “Yes, I am a sinner. Yes, I was defeated. Yes, I failed. Yes, I am terrible. But I am here because Jesus is my Savior!” That is the blowing of the trumpets. By following the battle plan given by God to Joshua, they overcame Jericho.
