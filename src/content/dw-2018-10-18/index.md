When we begin to live solely unto the Lord, we rise above outward circumstances. Few experienced more tribulations than the apostle Paul (2 Cor. 11:23–28). He could have complained, saying that things were too hard, but since he lived unto Christ, such hardships became the means of his strength (2 Cor. 12:9–10).
