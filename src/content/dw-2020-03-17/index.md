_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,  
set apart for the gospel of God Which He promised beforehand  
through His prophets in the holy Scriptures"  
\-Romans 1:1-2  
_

The entire Old Testament is full of Christ, the gospel promised by  
God (John 5:39, Luke 24:27). Now in these times, the reality of all the prophecies in the Old Testament is available for us to gain! All the records of people, objects, and events in the Old Testament are gospel messages to us, in the hope that we would gain and enjoy Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as the reality of the gospel of God.
