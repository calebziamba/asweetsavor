_Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. â€” First Samuel 19:18_

David fled to Samuel. When Saul heard this, he sent messengers to seize David. When they arrived, they met a company of prophets led by Samuel. The Spirit of God came upon the messengers, and they began prophesying also! Perhaps they prophesied that David would become king.

Saul, of course, was more upset than ever. He sent another group of messengers who also began to prophesy with the group of prophets. Saul sent a third group, and the same thing happened again.

You have to love the Lord for His way of handling things. Not only is He powerful, wise, and lovely, but He is so humorous. How glorious and wonderful it is to follow Him!
