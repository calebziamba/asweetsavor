_"Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,  
set apart for the gospel of God Which He promised beforehand  
through His prophets in the holy Scriptures"  
\-Romans 1:1-2  
_

The Old Testament is full of gospel messages that contain the promise of Christ.

In the age of Moses, God promised the Israelites that He would raise up a prophet like Moses. This prophet was Christ, who is the Son of God over the house of God. This was the gospel promised  to the children of Israel during Moses’ time (Deut. 18:15; Acts 3:22; Heb. 3:6).

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, page 31.
