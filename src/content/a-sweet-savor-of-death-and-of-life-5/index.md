> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
> 
> \- 2 Corinthians 2:14-16, KJV

Many would be bothered if you began to preach to some the savour of death unto death. They’d say, “What are you talking about? Didn’t God want everybody saved and not one fallen? Don't you know that?” And when you say, “We're just a savour,” they’d say, “don't you know, Romans told us, if you don't have a preacher, then who can hear?”

Brothers, I don't argue. I realize there are all these verses, but you must look at the person and not look at the work. When you are a proper savour, I'm pretty sure you preach; you open your mouth, but when you open your mouth, that is different with our soulish way of opening our mouth. We begin to realize, Lord there's nothing more important than us being in the Lord's presence.
