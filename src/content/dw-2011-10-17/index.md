_Even as it is right for me to think this concerning you all because you have me in your heart, since both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all fellow partakers with me of grace. For God is my witness how I long after you all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus. â€” Philippians 1:7-8_

If any local church is bent upon doing something, yet in doing so disregards the servant of the Lord who raised them up, there is something wrong with that church. Every church should always remember their source, and the servants of the Lord should always be one with Christ when considering those the Lord has committed to him.
