_Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel. — Philippians 1:27_

To struggle together with this faith does not imply that great deeds must be done. It does imply, however, that much can happen even out of seemingly small occurrences when we stand with the gospel’s operation. The gospel produces surprises. It may seem as if nothing is happening out of your labor, and then all of a sudden, something is manifested.

For instance, many years ago I went to a certain small locality. Outwardly, we did not do much. In fact, we even went fishing. But because of that time together, some began to take this way of the church life. For these many years they have remained about the same, but now today there is a young man present with us whose father was caught during that time. Who knows what that young man will become in the Lord’s hands? This is the faith of the gospel, and this is what we should be struggling alongside.
