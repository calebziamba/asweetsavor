_“Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, For I am sick with love.” — Song of Songs 2:5_ In the past she testified, “I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys” (SS. 2:1). Now, however, she is more experienced. She realizes that she needs strength to enjoy the Lord and to experience His riches. Therefore she turns to the church in order to continue enjoying the One she is seeking.

The capacity of one individual to enjoy the Lord is limited. As long as we are joined to the church and live in the church life, however, the capacity of brothers and sisters becomes our capacity. So she cries out to her companions, “Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples.”
