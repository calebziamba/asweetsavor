_Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah._ _– Genesis 20:2_

Being blameless doesn’t mean never making mistakes. A blameless man also fails. Like Abraham, he may repeat the same mistake. When Abraham went down to Egypt, he allowed Pharaoh to take his wife (Gen. 12:9–20). Later, he failed in the same way, allowing Abimelech to take his wife (20:1–18). God prevented Sarah from being harmed and protected her both times.
