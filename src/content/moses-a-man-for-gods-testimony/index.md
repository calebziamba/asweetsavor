Through Moses, God was able to raise up His people as His corporate testimony, forming the children of Israel into a great nation... God used Moses to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness, forming them as His living testimony on the earth. Moses was set apart for this. The Lord used him to go beyond the calling of individuals to the further stage of establishing God's corporate testimony...

The Bible indicates that before Christ returns, He will gain His corporate testimony as a Bride prepared for her Bridegroom. Today, as we are watching and waiting for the Lord's return, many believers are still in bondage in Egypt...I pray that some today would rise up to care for the Lord's testimony and prepare the way for His return.
