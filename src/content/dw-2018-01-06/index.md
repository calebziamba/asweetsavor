_“Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has.”_ _– Genesis 24:36_

The Holy Spirit not only testifies of God so that we may leave everything and follow Him but also tells us how wonderful the Lord Jesus is. The more we listen to the Spirit, the more wonderful the Lord becomes to us. The Holy Spirit testifies of the Lord. He reminds us again and again that God loves His Son and that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him. The Son has received everything from the Father, and He also receives us as His Rebekah.
