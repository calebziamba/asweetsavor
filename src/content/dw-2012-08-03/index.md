Let me give a personal testimony. When I began working at a university library, I was given the title of instructor, although I did not teach. The second year, I was promoted to assistant professor, and the third year I was promoted to associate professor. When my supervisor left to become a director of another university’s library, he said he would create a position there for me.

By the time he called to offer me the newly created position, I told him I had to turn it down, for the Lord had called me to serve Him full time. He asked whether I would have come if he had called two weeks earlier. I answered that I didn’t know, for I would have had to pray about it. Before, I was under my employers, for I was their servant, but now that I am serving the Lord, I am over them, for I am a servant of Christ.
