_Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, and they said to David, "You shall not come in here, but the blind and lame will turn you away"; thinking, "David cannot enter here."_ _Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is the city of David._  
_— Second Samuel 5:6-7_

_And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband._  
_— Revelation 21:2_

After seven years of ruling over Judah in Hebron, the way was opened for David to be finally crowned king of all Israel (2 Sam. 5:1–3). The first thing he did was to capture the city of Jerusalem from the Jebusites (5:6–7).

Zion is the name given to the heights of Jerusalem. It is also called the city of David, and David’s palace was built there. Before David, the kings and judges ruled from their home towns. Even Samuel did this when he ruled from Ramah. David, however, gained a city named “Foundation of Peace.” This city became the center of God’s work. Even we in the New Testament age await the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). The fact that David saw the value of Jerusalem testifies to how much David was a man after God’s heart.
