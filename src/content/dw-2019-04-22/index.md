_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

The Song of Songs is the story of human lives. It begins with, “The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.” The songs spoken of here are, in fact, human lives. We each have our own life, and that life is a song. In particular, every saved person’s life is a song before the Lord, for it is impossible to have a relationship with the Lord that is without any spiritual “music.”
