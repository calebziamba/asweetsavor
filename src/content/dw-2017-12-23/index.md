_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _— Philippians 2:14–15_

The Lord lit us to shine with others as His testimony. We do not belong under any basket; we belong on the lampstand, for we are lamps the Lord has lit to shine out to this generation.
