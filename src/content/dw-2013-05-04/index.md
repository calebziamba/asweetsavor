_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith._ _– Philippians 3:8-9_

A man who isn’t focused will go nowhere. Today he will dream of doing one thing, and tomorrow he will dream of doing another. This shows that he is not focused. No other book of the Bible encourages us to be as focused as Philippians. It tells us that we should only have one focus—the Lord Himself.
