_The Holy Spirit of the promise...is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory. — Ephesians 1:13b-14_ If someone asks us, “What will it be like in the next age?” we should say, “Have you ever enjoyed the Lord in your spirit? That is the foretaste of our enjoyment in the age to come.” When we enjoy the Lord in this age, that is to experience a pledge. The overwhelming joy and peace that we experience at such times is a pledge to tell us what we will experience constantly in the next age.

Whenever we enjoy the Lord in our spirit, we get excited. We realize, “Hallelujah! I have the Lord's presence. Oh, it is so good! It is so wonderful!” This is the foretaste that the Lord has given to us. It is the pledge of our inheritance, for us to realize that in eternity we will be joyful and satisfied. Our enjoyment in eternity will be even richer, higher, and fuller than what we are experiencing now.
