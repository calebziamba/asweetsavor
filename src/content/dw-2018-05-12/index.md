_Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh._ _— Romans 1:1-3_

The gospel of God, centered on Jesus Christ, was promised by God in the Old Testament and is unveiled to us in the New Testament. Christ is the center, the content, and the sole focus of everything in Romans.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; Volume 1, pages 5-6.
