_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith._ _– Philippians 3:8-9_

Philippians is extremely pure. Paul was not fighting any “isms” in this book, such as Judaism or Gnosticism, which he had to deal with in other books. The only debate he had was whether he should choose to live or die (Phil. 1:21–24). Paul had no hidden motive. There was no impure or problematic background. Only Christ is presented in this book. Paul encouraged us to press on to lay hold of Christ (3:12), gain Christ (3:8), and be found in Him (3:9).

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 6-7.
