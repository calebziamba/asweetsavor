After we experience Christ as grace and reality, we will have Him as our satisfaction. The story of the Lord changing the water into wine at the wedding feast in Cana is quite well-known. After this miracle, the master of the feast told the bridegroom, in John 2:10,

_Every man serves the good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now._
