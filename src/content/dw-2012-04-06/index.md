_I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad. Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together. — Psalm 34:1-3_

_Have mercy upon me, O God, According to Your lovingkindness: According to the multitude of Your tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me. — Psalms 51:1-3_ A person can fail without being defeated, just as a person can be defeated without having failed. The secret of never being defeated is to always have fresh experiences of Christ. Even in David’s most abysmal failures, he still turned to the Lord. For example, after Nathan, the prophet, confronted David about his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba, David had a genuine repentance (Psalm 51). He never became so defeated that he even momentarily considered giving up the Lord.
