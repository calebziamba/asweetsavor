_So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed....So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. â€” Exodus 17:11, 13_

As with Joshua, the first lesson we must learn as we begin to serve the Lord is this: every spiritual blessing initially comes from Christ and from those interceding for us. Still, the victory is ours, even though it was not truly ours alone. It was both the prayer of Moses and the sword of Joshua that won the victory.
