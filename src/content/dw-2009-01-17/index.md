_Again he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not ford, for the water had risen, enough water to swim in, a river that could not be forded. — Ezekiel 47:5_

_He said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he brought me back to the bank of the river....It will come about that every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes, will live. And there will be very many fish, for these waters go there and the others become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes." — Ezekiel 47:6, 9b_ When I first became a Christian, I proclaimed to the Lord that I desired to serve Him my entire life. Now, 50 years later, I am learning a little of how to float in the stream and how to let Him carry me. As I rest in this flow, looking upward, I see how the Lord and His purpose and economy have never changed, even in the midst of all the many things that have happened over the years. At such times I truly worship Him for who He is.

The Lord's measuring causes us to become a living testimony of Christ, both individually and corporately. Through this process of measuring, exposing, and possessing, we become totally one with Christ for His move on the earth. When we have become one with the Lord in His flow, He surely gains His testimony on earth through us.
