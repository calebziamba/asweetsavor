_The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth._ _– John 1:14_

Many Christians develop a taste for outward blessings and never desire the Giver Himself. Sadly, they don’t really desire Christ, but they want all kinds of gifts from Christ. That is why their Christian lives are so poor.

We need to realize that the Lord loves us and is full of grace towards us, desiring that we would enjoy Himself as grace. If we receive His grace in this way, our Christian lives will become very prevailing.
