_And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will....

Now David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption. — Acts 13:22, 36

_One of the great names in the Bible is that of David, king of Israel. Most people know how he faced Goliath as a youth, and many appreciate the psalms he wrote. In fact, he wrote Psalm 23, the most famous psalm in the Bible. He had his faults and committed some serious sins, yet the apostle Paul tells us that David was a man after God’s own heart (Acts 13:22) and a man who served his own generation (Acts 13:36). Even though he did some terrible things for which he paid a great price, David was still able to serve his generation in a manner that was after God’s own heart.
