The skill of teaching is more than just having eloquence. We must be able to teach what the Lord has given us and constituted into us. If we are unable to do so, then we are merely lecturers parroting a textbook. True teachers teach that which has been constituted into them through life experiences over many years. Spiritually it is very much the same. In order to be approved, we must have the ability to teach what has been constituted into us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 150-151.
