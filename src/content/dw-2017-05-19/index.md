Every life demands a certain kind of living. We cannot say, “I have the human life, but I will live like a dog.” That is nonsensical, for our human life demands that we have a human living. In the same way, when we were born again, we received the highest life, the very life of God, and that life within us demands that we have a living that matches God’s divine life. We should not be in a “spiritual coma.” Our living should match the new life we have received.
