_The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth._ _– John 1:14_

The Lord is full of grace for us to enjoy. Unfortunately, we often misunderstand God and assume He is angry with us. We may even tell the Lord, “Lord, I did something wrong again. Please don’t punish me too much.” Actually, we should realize that the Lord is not out to punish us, and He doesn’t have a harsh countenance towards us. Rather, His countenance towards us is always pleasant, expressing His desire that we would enjoy Him as grace.
