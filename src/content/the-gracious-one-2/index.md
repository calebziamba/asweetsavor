> "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;"
> 
> \- Ephesians 2:8

Brothers, by grace you were saved and by grace you love the Lord. But for some reason, even if you’re saved and you love the Lord, it becomes a custom. To express His grace doesn’t mean “I go to church; I go to the meetings.” No, no. God says, “Something new! Something fresh!” John should come! Not an old Zacharias (“God remembers”), but the reality of His remembering: He gives you grace. By grace, a lot of things can happen. It would be great if, in the church in your locality, there could be ten, twenty, or thirty brothers and sisters who could declare, “I want to live a life by grace!”
