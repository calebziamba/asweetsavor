_So David arose and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. â€” First Samuel 27:2_

When David came to Gath the first time, he pretended to be mad for his own survival (1 Sam. 21:10-15). When we are young Christians, we also may feel the social pressure at work to go to parties to be accepted. After a number of years of following the Lord and growing as Christians, however, we will no longer feel we have to behave in a way to please people.

We are like David in his return to Gath. In the beginning, the world took advantage of us. Now, the world is under us. After passing through some experiences of knowing and trusting the Lord, we are no longer the same. Instead of becoming anxious or pressured in our situation, we reign as kings.
