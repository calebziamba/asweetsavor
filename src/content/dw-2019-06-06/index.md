_“Draw me; we will run after thee.”_

_– Song of Songs 1:4, KJV_

This verse indicates that when the Lord draws us, others will also follow Him with us.Brothers and sisters, when we are with the virgins, we must respect our influence on others’ pursuing of the Lord. We are so crucial that when we live, everyone lives, and when we die, everyone dies.
