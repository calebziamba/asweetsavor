Isaac’s second mistake was lying to the men of Gerar, saying that Rebekah was his sister. Without God’s protection, Rebekah could have been joined to another man. Since Rebekah was so beautiful, it was surprising that Abimelech, the king of Gerar, didn’t marry her. On the contrary, he reproached Isaac, saying, “Certainly she is your wife! How then did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” (v. 9). God’s preserving power is amazing. While Isaac dwelt in Gerar, he “sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold” (v. 12). This was God’s preserving. Later, he dug four wells which, by God’s preserving power, all had water (vv. 19–22, 25). God always had flowing water ready for him. Although Isaac wasn’t clear, he still lived in God’s preserving power and blessing.
