Harmony doesn’t come easily. To think the same thing means to consider only Christ, who humbled Himself by becoming a man, even taking the form of a bond-servant, and dying on the cross for us (Phil. 2:7–8). So today, let us have a mind to gain and possess Christ. May Christ be formed in us until we are occupied with nothing but Christ Himself.

Excerpted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](https://www.asweetsavor.org/book-philippians/)_ by Titus Chu, pp. 258 - 259
