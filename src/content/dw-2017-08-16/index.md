_"The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham...and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’"_ _– Acts 7:2-3_

Today the church needs people who know that all the blessings are God Himself. Without God, all Christian work is in vain. Without God, we lose the foundation of our first vision.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 102.
