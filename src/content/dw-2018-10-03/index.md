After the split with Paul, Barnabas is not mentioned again in Acts and seemingly was no longer in fellowship with Paul. At this point it, would be very easy to judge Barnabas as a failure. However, even if Barnabas’ departure was a mistake, that did not mean he was no longer of any use to the Lord. We are prone to think that those with defects should be tossed aside, but the secret of fellowship is to not toss anyone aside.

Those who know how to fellowship would never write off any believer. We should never have the attitude, “Either you are for me or against me” (see Mark 9:40). In Paul’s case, I am so thankful that he did not exclude Barnabas but rather continued to recognize him as a fellow apostle among the churches (1 Cor. 9:6).

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 142-143.
