_Again he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not ford, for the water had risen, enough water to swim in, a river that could not be forded. — Ezekiel 47:5_ After the previous three stages, the Lord comes in to measure you one more time, so that the flow fully covers you and becomes waters to swim in. In the original language, the phrase “to swim in” can also be translated “to float in.” As a non-swimmer, I appreciate floating, because it means that no self-effort is involved. It is the flow that carries you. A person who floats along in life faces the heavens, as opposed to a dead person who floats face down. We who are carried in life look up to the heavens, to a clear sky, where we see only the Lord as we float in the stream. Praise the Lord! We will be measured to the point that we will be carried in the flow and be delivered from all considerations other than the Lord Himself.
