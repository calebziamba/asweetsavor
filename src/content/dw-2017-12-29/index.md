When he reached his destination, the servant stood by a well and waited for God’s working. The Holy Spirit doesn’t do things Himself. He waits for God to move and cooperates with Him. As the servant waited by the well of water, he prayed, “May it be that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink,’ and who answers, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels also’—may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac” (Gen. 24:14).

This prayer seems unreasonable. Only Rebekah, who was chosen by God, would do this kind of thing. We who respond to the gospel all do something seemingly unreasonable. We believe that Jesus died, resurrected, and ascended for us. We believe that His blood cleanses all our sins and that He dispenses His life into us. The word of the gospel is a stumbling block and foolishness to those who do not believe, but to us who believe it is the wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:18–25).
