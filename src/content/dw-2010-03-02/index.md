_I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. — Philippians 4:12_

You must tell the Lord, “Lord, You must work on my emotions constantly. I am willing to be equipped in my emotions. I do not want to waste my love on anything other than You. I desire to love You alone.” If this is the case, you will have a pure emotion.

Furthermore, your mind should match your emotion. You should have no desire for anything in the world. If the Lord grants you something, you should praise Him. If He does not, you should still praise Him. You should know how to be abased and how to abound; in everything you should learn the secret of how to be filled and how to hunger, of how to abound and how to lack (Phil. 4:12).

In other words, you have to learn the secret. Your mind should not be occupied with being short of something, or having abundance. You should set your mind on the things that are above, where Christ is. Then your mind will be protected, and you can have a healthy will.
