_“Awake, O north wind,_ _And come, wind of the south;_ _Make my garden breathe out fragrance,_ _Let its spices be wafted abroad._ _May my beloved come into his garden_ _And eat its choice fruits!”_ _— Song of Songs 4:16_

The seeker also realizes that her experience and constitution have made her precious. She has produced all kinds of choicest fruit and spices, and she has received so many blessings. She is not common before the Lord anymore. She has paid a high price and shed many tears. She has also experienced much enjoyment.
