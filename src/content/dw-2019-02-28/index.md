_I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly.  
__– Philippians 2:19_

When Watchman Nee decided that the work in Taiwan should be developed, he contacted three coworkers, telling them to move to Taiwan immediately. One of the three was a doctor who gave up his practice to answer this call to go to Taiwan. He honored the organic order in the body. As a result, the church life established in Taiwan was healthy and strong. To know the organic order in the body is crucial to gaining approvedness.
