_And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect._ _– Romans 12:2_

Romans 12:2 indicates that if we want to experience spiritual growth, we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. The renewing of our mind means that many things change in our mind. Our viewpoints, considerations, and evaluations may all change. We may have thought one way about something, but when our mind is renewed, we will think differently about it. These changes indicate that our mind has been renewed, and once our mind is renewed, we will be transformed in our living.

Adapted from _[Romans: The Gospel of God](/book-romans/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; Volume One, page 17.
