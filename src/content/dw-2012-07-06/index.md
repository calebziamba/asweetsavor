_The men of David said to him, "Behold, this is the day of which the Lord said to you, 'Behold; I am about to give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'" Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly. It came about afterward that David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s robe. — 1 Samuel 24:4-5_

David’s heart troubled him because he had improperly touched the Lord’s anointed. Since the Lord had anointed Saul, he was the Lord’s responsibility, not David’s.

If we are to have a church life, we need to learn this. Whenever we criticize our fellow believers or treat them improperly in the eyes of others, our hearts should trouble us immediately. The Lord is their Lord. It is not our place to criticize them (Rom. 14:10). Every believer is in the Lord’s heart. He desires to lead every one of them into glory. If we do not see this and treat our fellow believers with grace, our heart should trouble us.
