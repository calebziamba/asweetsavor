If you do not have any constitution of life, you will not be able to speak for the Lord. Even should you fast and pray and repent, your speaking will only be at best like the speaking of Balaamâ€™s donkey. The Lord may be forced to use you, since you are the speaker, but after you conclude your sharing, you may be put aside by the Lord as one who is of little worth.
