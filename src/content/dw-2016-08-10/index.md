_Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires._ _– Galatians 5:24_

_But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world._ _– Galatians 6:14_

Sometimes when we read these verses, we say, “Praise the Lord! I have been crucified, and sin has also been crucified.” It is true that you have died to sin and that the old man has been crucified. However, the body of sin has not yet been crucified. As long as you are living on the earth, you will still have the body of sin, and the flesh, the passions, the lusts, and the world will be able to tempt you and cause you to fall. If you are not cautious, the world will seduce you through your lusts and erode the personality that God has constituted in you through His divine life.
