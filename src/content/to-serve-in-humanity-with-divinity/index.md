Few serving ones realize that a proper service before the Lord is an exhibition of humanity with divinity. The origin of this serving life in humanity is the humanity of Jesus. Most serving ones, on the contrary, often seek other things for their serving life. First, they seek high revelations and rich knowledge. Second, they seek to become dynamic and powerful. Third, they seek after a spiritual exercise which manifests authority. Certainly these are necessary, but not many serving ones realize that these factors are not the real source of an effective operation. To serve effectively there must be humanity with divinity.

##### [Article 1: The Necessity of Humanity with Divinity](/wp-content/uploads/to-serve-in-humanity-01.pdf)

If a church is to come up to God’s standard it must be filled with brothers and sisters whose humanity expresses divinity. Although every church must have life, truth, and a healthy service, only a church with brothers who possess a high humanity that is filled with divinity can satisfy God.

The book of Romans provides us with a number of insights into the effectiveness of Paul’s operation as a servant of the Lord, showing us his commitment, his constitution, the content of his labor, and the display in his labor of the humanity of Jesus.

##### [Article 3: The Apostle Paul’s Uplifted Humanity with Divinity in First Corinthians](/wp-content/uploads/to-serve-in-humanity-03.pdf)

In this article we begin to consider the uplifted humanity of Paul as it is displayed in the book of First Corinthians. This book shows us that our serving life is a life of struggling, and it also shows us how, in so many different ways, Paul presented himself to the Corinthians as one with an uplifted humanity.

##### [Article 4: Struggling in an Uplifted Humanity with Commitment (1)](/wp-content/uploads/to-serve-in-humanity-04.pdf)

The book of First Corinthians indicates that the serving life is a struggling life. It is a life through the will of God, in the local churches, and with high expectations for the saints.

##### [Article 5: An Uplifted Humanity Necessary to Serve the Saints Living in their Self-Life, which is Most Manifest in the Matter of Divisions](/wp-content/uploads/to-serve-in-humanity-05.pdf)

The self-life is the source of all of the problems in the church life. This was true in the church in Corinth, and it is also true in us. Even if we truly love the Lord and the church, our self-life may be quite strong. To serve the saints who are in such a situation, and in particular to deal with the problem of division, which is the clearest manifestation of the self-life, we must have an uplifted humanity.

Although Paul dealt with the church in Corinth in a very strong way, he did so with an uplifted humanity, in a way that was full of grace. He was in a different realm, in which he only cared for God’s economy.

##### [Article 7: Struggling in an Uplifted Humanity with Commitment (2)](/wp-content/uploads/to-serve-in-humanity-07.pdf)

The church in Corinth was like most other local churches, having many problems that came from the saints living in their flesh. In this message we cover some of the problems in the human realm that came upon the church in Corinth. By the way that Paul dealt with such problems we can surely see what a spiritual man he was.

The matter of the spiritual gifts, and learning how to exercise them properly, can be one of the biggest frustrations in the local church life. To operate properly, we must realize that all spiritual experiences are subjective, and we must have a degree of spiritual maturity.

The apostle Paul lived under the realization that we will all come before the judgment seat of Christ. Practically speaking, however, such a living was carried out in the church life, in his care for the saints. In this message we continue to see this brought out in Second Corinthians.
