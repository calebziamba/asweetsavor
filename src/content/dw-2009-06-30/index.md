_Turn again, O Jehovah, our captivity, Like the streams in the south. Those who sow in tears Will reap with a ringing shout. — Psalm 126:4-5_

How does the Lord release us from our captivity? By asking us to pay a price. In verse five of this psalm the Lord tells us, “Now that you desire to come out of your captivity, it is very simple. You just need to sow in tears.”

We might ask, what does this mean? What is it that we sow? The Lord would say, “Go and sow yourself.” When we sow in tears it means that our self-life is over. We realize that we must sow our very selves into the ground to die. We no longer have any choice. We realize, “If I want to be delivered from the captivity of my self, then I must bury myself and die. That is my future. That is the only road ahead of me.”
