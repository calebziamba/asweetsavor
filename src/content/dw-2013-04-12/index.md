_So Gad came to David that day and said to him, “Go up, erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” David went up according to the word of Gad, just as the Lord had commanded._ _– Second Samuel 24:18-19_

The threshing floor where David saw the Angel of the Lord became the location of the temple (2 Sam. 24:15-25). Even out of David’s defeat, something was gained for the Lord.
