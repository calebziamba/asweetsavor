_"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,  
beware of the false circumcision."  
\- Philippians 3:2  
_

Such teachers do not come with anything obviously evil. Instead they come with an open Bible. What they say is according to the Bible, yet their focus is not Christ, so as we listen we are taken away from the living person of Christ Himself.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 181.
