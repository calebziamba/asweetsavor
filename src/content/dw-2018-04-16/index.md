_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

These verses are profound in terms of experience. In the Old Testament, a drink offering was a special portion of wine poured out as a voluntary offering (Num. 15:1–10) upon one of the basic or required offerings (Lev. 1–7) that they might be more acceptable and pleasing to the Lord.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 135.
