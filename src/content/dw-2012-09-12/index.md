_Go forth, O daughters of Zion, And behold king Solomon with the crown Wherewith his mother crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart. — Song of Songs 3:11_

The daughters of Zion—the overcomers in the church—are those who help us to become the Lord’s crown. Those who are stronger take care of us and support us so that we may become such a crown to the Lord.

On the day of the Lord’s espousals, those exercised ones who love Christ will crown the Lord. The crown will comprise those whom they have helped to follow the Lord and to commit themselves to Him in love.
