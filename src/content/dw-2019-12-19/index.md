_“Your eyes are like doves.”  
– Song of Songs 1:15  
_

We do not become pure as soon as we believe in the Lord. This is why we can see religion and politics being practiced even among us in the church. How can we be preserved from impurity? Once you make your own plans, consider your own benefit, or want to gain something for yourself, you lose your spiritual insight. If you are not willing to pay the price to follow the Lord, you will not have spiritual insight. The Lord will say, “Only when your eyes are like doves are you pure, and only when you have spiritual insight, can you stand before Me.”

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 66.
