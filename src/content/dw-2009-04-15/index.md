_But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. — Galatians 6:14_

_But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts. — Galatians 5:24_

We have also been set free from the world. The Bible tells us that the world is Satan's kingdom: “We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one” (1Ã‚Â John 5:19). Satan is the “ruler of this world” (John 16:11). But by believing in the Lord Jesus we have been set free from the world (Gal. 6:14).

Formerly we “conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts” (Eph. 2:3). But in our new position we are free from our flesh, so that it can no longer bind us (Gal. 5:24).
