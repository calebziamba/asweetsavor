_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

Praise the Lord that there is no respect of persons with Him. We should not despise ourselves. We should not feel that we do not possess the gifts or talents that others have. We should only care for our relationship with the Lord.  
  
If there is love between us and the Lord, we will feel we have the most beautiful song, one that is special to us. As long as such a relationship of love exists between us and the Lord, no matter what song we like or what song we pursue, we will find that the Lord is our song of songs, for He is the most precious One to us.
