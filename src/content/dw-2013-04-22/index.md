_I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ._ _– Galatians 1:6-7_

The book of Galatians shows us the problem of religion, which is especially typical of those raised in a Christian home. Because they have absorbed the beliefs and practices of their parents, they unconsciously become persons under law.

This causes them to lose all their potential to develop and become useful to the Lord. They think that as long as they know the terminology, speak the right things, and don’t cause trouble, they are good Christians. Actually, this makes them hopeless and useless. Religion makes people hopeless. When we fall into religion, we lose our freedom in the spirit and instead focus on doing right things and speaking correct words.
