_So we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. — Romans 12:5_ We have also become the members of Christ. There are several verses which tell us this: “So we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another” (Rom. 12:5). “Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?” (1 Cor. 6:15a). “For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ” (1Ã‚Â Cor. 12:12). “For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church, because we are members of His Body” (Eph. 5:29-30).

We are now members of the Body of Christ, which means that we are members of Christ Himself. Unfortunately, in our human lives all of us were taught to be very individualistic, and this affects our understanding of salvation. When we first prayed to the Lord to receive Him, we assumed that our salvation was for ourselves. We certainly didn't have any thought that our salvation was for Christ. But the Lord would tell us, “You were saved because I needed you to be saved. You were saved to be a member of My Body.”
