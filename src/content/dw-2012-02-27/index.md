_A Psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who drove him away and he departed...._

_I sought the Lord, and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears. They looked to Him and were radiant, And their faces will never be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him And saved him out of all his troubles. — Psalm 34:4-6_

_O taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him! — Psalm 34:8_

I am impressed with David. He was able to say that the Lord had delivered him from all his fears. This is meaningful, because God had not yet delivered David from those who sought his life. In fact, things seemed to be getting worse, not better! If someone were trying to kill you, it would seem logical to ask the Lord to deliver you from this one.

Once you have been delivered from your fears, however, you are able to tell your enemy, “Who are you? Why should I be afraid of you?” As sons of God, we, like David, should be able to say, “The Lord has delivered me from all my fears!” Then, even if our enemies increase, we will still be able to rest. David was even able to say,

_O taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him! — Psalm 34:8_
