_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ._ _â€“ Philippians 3:8_

If we are pure but not focused, we will go nowhere. We will keep moving around, but nothing will come of it. If we are focused but not pure, we will become ambitious. Just to be pure or just to be focused is not enough. We need both.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 7-8.
