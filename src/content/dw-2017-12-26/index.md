_“I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live, but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”_ _– Genesis 24:3-4_

In the persons of Abraham, Isaac, and Abraham's servant, we see the work of the triune God: God the Father (Abraham) desires a wife for God the Son; God the Son (Isaac) is waiting for the church as His the bride (Rebekah); God the Spirit (the servant) follows the command of the Father to gain a bride for the Son.
