_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

_Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God._ _– 2 Corinthians 1:3-4_

When we console others, we should do so out of the high value we ascribe to them, being willing to pay any price. Furthermore, we should console others according to Christ and the experience of Christ (2 Cor. 1:3–4). As we experience Christ and as we are with others, we bring them this experiential Christ for their consolation. When we are so one with Christ, we can truly console others in love.
