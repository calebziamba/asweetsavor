Some brothers have a strict character but lack the divine life to back it up. Such a person is like Moses; when you see him, you see the law. He is very strict concerning how you should walk, how you should laugh, and how you should shake hands with others. Such a person’s personality is tough and strong. Since there is insufficient constitution of the divine life, however, his characteristic of strictness becomes his limitation instead of his blessing. His strict character becomes a hindrance to the church’s advancing. People under his perfecting cannot love the Lord, because their focus is off. Instead of focusing on Christ, they focus on how to become a perfect person—how to speak perfectly, how to carry things out perfectly, how to walk perfectly, and how to live a perfect life.
