_Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches. Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?_ _– 2 Corinthians 11:28-29_

This characteristic of Paul, that he was weak when others were weak, is what made him so fruitful and effective in raising up churches. He reminded the elders of the church in Ephesus that “for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears” (Acts 20:31).
