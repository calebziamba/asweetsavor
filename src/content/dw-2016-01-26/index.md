_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... â€”Philippians 2:1_

Sometimes instead of being rich in encouragement and consolation, we are rich in personal preferences. If we can only love those who share our views and practices, our agape love has disappeared, for we no longer value others according to Christ.
