_Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. ...When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory. â€” Colossians 3:4_

As we hold the Head and receive the supply of Christ through the joints and the sinews, we also must seek the things that are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God (3:1). In the church life, do not look at anything other than Christ and the things pertaining to Christ. Then, as those who enjoy Christ as our life, one day we will be manifested with Him in glory (3:4). Enjoy the strength in the Body today, seek after the things where Christ is, and await His return. This is the message of the book of Colossians.
