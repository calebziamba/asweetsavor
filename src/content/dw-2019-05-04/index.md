_The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s._  
_– Song of Songs 1:1_

Can we tell others that we live in the song of songs? If not, we are not in a normal and healthy situation before the Lord. Perhaps in the past we have advanced through a number of the stages of spiritual experience portrayed in the Song of Songs. However, if the Lord is not our song of songs at this moment, we can no longer say we have a place within this book.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance,](/song-of-songs-dr/)_  
by Titus Chu, page 18.
