_To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, the called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. — Romans 1:7_

Through the gospel of God, we all become the called saints — _hagios_, the holy ones (Rom. 1:7).

First, the gospel is just Christ. Second, when you touch this Christ you become holy. Third, whenever Christ is touched and realized by you, there is a calling.

Calling involves three things. The Lord is calling us to meet all our needs. He is calling us to tell us His desire. Finally, His calling is with a purpose. Remember that calling meets your needs, calling speaks of His desire, and calling is related to His purpose.
