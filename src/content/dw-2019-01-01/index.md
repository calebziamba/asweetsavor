We need not be afraid that our mistakes could be severe enough to cause God to drop us. In fact, He is able to turn our mistakes into something good for us, as Paul says,

_God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose._ _– Romans 8:28_

We may not realize what is going on, but we receive God’s blessing all the time, even when we make mistakes. God keeps on blessing us with His riches. We should know the secret: we can never leave God’s hand.

Adapted from _[A Sketch of Genesis](/book-gen-sketch "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, pages 131-132.
