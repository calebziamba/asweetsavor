_I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all._ _— Philippians 1:3–4_

Suppose there are three Christian brothers. Brother A prays for Brother B, “Lord, he is too strong. Please help him become more sensitive.” Brother B prays for Brother A, “Lord, he is too timid. Please help him become more aggressive.” Brother C prays for them both, “Lord, they are too argumentative. Please deal with their strong opinions.” Each assumes he knows what the Lord should do. There is very little thankfulness.

The church in Philippi had problems, but Paul didn’t talk about them. Instead, he just thanked God all the time for these dear saints. He offered prayer for them with joy.
