_“You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free....So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.”_ _– John 8:32, 36_

How can the truth make us free? This truth is not a matter of knowing things doctrinally. Doctrinal knowledge can never set us free. It is when we enjoy Christ as grace, reality, and satisfaction that we are set free. When we have Christ as our freedom, neither sin, nor the world, nor anything negative can bind us. When we enjoy Christ, we can say, “I have the truth. I have the Son. I’m free!”
