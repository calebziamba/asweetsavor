Praise the Lord, eternal life is here. And I’m so thankful, God is always here. And I’m so thankful, God knows exactly what is happening and what is the best for each one of us, and that He is able to create whatever I need. Actually God already planned out everything for us, we just have to walk in what He has planned and to take hold of this eternal life.
