When we were born again, we were set free, yet at the same time we became slaves. Romans 6:18 says,

_Having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness._

To be enslaved means that we have no choice. Even when we try to be unrighteous, something within us compels us to be righteous. This shows us that now we are slaves of righteousness.

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ,](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 56-57.
