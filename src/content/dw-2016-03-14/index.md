_Then the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”_ _– Genesis 6:3_

Regardless how the Lord leads us, we need to be pure. Otherwise, we open the door to the flesh. In the beginning, we stray from the Lord just a little, and then gradually we move further and further away without realizing it. We may think we are fine since we are still active in the church life, yet our heart is with our degree, business, house, and cars instead of the Lord. We have become fleshly. This is not a sudden fall. If we fell suddenly, we would realize it and get up immediately. For example, after suddenly losing our temper, we repent. That kind of fall is not as serious as a gradual easing into mixture, with the result of becoming fleshly.
