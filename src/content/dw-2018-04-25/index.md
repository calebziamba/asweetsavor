_But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me._ _—Philippians 2:17–18_

In spite of the fact that Paul was imprisoned and in a seemingly hopeless situation, he rejoiced and was able to share his joy with the Philippians because of their sacrifice and service of faith. He was now ready to be poured out as a drink offering upon their sacrifice. What caused them to grow to this point? It was the grace they had partaken of together with Paul (Phil. 1:7).
