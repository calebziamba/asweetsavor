_Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross._ _—Philippians 2:8_

If it were me, I might have been tempted to reveal who I was to my brother James or my cousin John. Jesus, however, never did this. He would not be found in appearance as being different from other men. He certainly had the ability, as Satan said, to turn stones into bread, but He never did such things for His own sake. While He was among the despised Galileans, He lived as they lived. If Jesus were to be found in appearance as a man among us today, He would follow the prevailing conventions of our time. He would wear clothes similar to ours, use a computer, and probably even carry a cell phone. This is what it means to be “found in appearance as a man.”
