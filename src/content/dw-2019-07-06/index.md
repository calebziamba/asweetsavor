_“Rightly do they love you.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:4_

May the Lord anoint these words so that we can love Him rightly! And may the Lord gain a group of people to love Him rightly in the churches today! Only then can the churches be built up.

Adapted from [The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr), page 32.
