_“I am black, but comely,_ _O ye daughters of Jerusalem,_ _As the tents of Kedar,_ _As the curtains of Solomon.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:5_

At first, when she saw the daughters of Jerusalem—signifying those who are saved but who do not seek after the Lord—and the virgins living in the church life—those who do love the Lord and seek after Him—the seeker did not realize her own blackness, nor did she see the blackness of others, for the simple reason that everyone was black.

One day, however, she was brought into the king’s chambers, and at that point she began to realize that she herself was black. Originally, she didn’t feel that she was that sinful, but now she realizes that she is indeed a fallen sinner. Now she has the realization, “Lord, I am black. I cannot do anything for You, nor can I function in the church life.”
