_“Awake, O north wind, And come, wind of the south; Make my garden breathe out fragrance, Let its spices be wafted abroad. May my beloved come into his garden And eat its choice fruits!” — Song of Songs 4:16_

Now the Lord’s beloved is at the height of joy, and thus she calls for the north and south winds, and for her beloved to come into His garden. She knows that the Lord enjoys her and treasures her, and she knows that the riches of life in her have become a supply and refreshment to others.
