_"Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in  
the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and  
camped before the city. ... Then he erected there an altar"  
\- Genesis 33:18, 20  
_

 On the one hand, Jacob knew he belonged to God and was restricted by Him, as represented by the altar. On the other hand, he was not bound by the earth but was free to move about as God directed, as represented by the tent. We shouldn’t restrict the Lord to a small place or a fixed form. We don’t belong to a work or a region, nor do they belong to us. We should simply give ourselves to the Lord and go where He leads. Wherever He sends us, we build an altar to Him there.
