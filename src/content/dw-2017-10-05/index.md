_“I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be blameless.”_ _– Genesis 17:1_

The fact that God was able to tell Abraham, “Walk before Me, and be blameless,” shows that Abraham manifested the gaining of God. Not only did God lead him, but he led God as well—God had worked on him to the extent that he could initiate an intercession to fulfill God’s will.
