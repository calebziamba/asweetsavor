_“The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, And I said, ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves?’ Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go Until I had brought him to my mother’s house, And into the room of her who conceived me.” — Song of Songs 3:3-4_ This was the Shulammite’s situation. Although the Lord asked her to leave her previous experience, she instead replied, “Catch the little foxes” (2:15). Then the Lord left, and she began to seek Him. However, she only sought Him on her bed, ignoring His call that she join Him in the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice. She sought the Lord’s presence in every way except the way that He desired.
