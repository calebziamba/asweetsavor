_But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know._ _– 1 John 2:20_

True teachers teach according to the anointing. Without the anointing, our teaching will not be effective.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu, page 151.
