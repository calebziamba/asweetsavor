_I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy. — Philippians 1:3-4_

_Even as it is right for me to think this concerning you all because you have me in your heart, since both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all fellow partakers with me of grace. — Philippians 1:7_ We have a song entitled, “O Lord, Everybody’s Home,” and yet we may not truly be “at home” with the saints. It is normal that we love the saints, yet for some reason we often fall into the trap of doing things out of duty or obligation, instead of out of love for one another. In all our relationships we should act and move according to the inward parts of Christ.

Not one believer should live by himself. Every one of us should live in this “golden triangle” of Christ, the apostles, and the saints. In this way we are all joined together in one spirit and in one soul, struggling together with the faith of the gospel (1:27).
