_Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion.... —Philippians 2:1_

When we properly encourage others, we do not merely encourage them to go on. Rather, something of us goes with them for their going on. In our encouragement, we walk beside them. We walk alongside others to strengthen them to conduct themselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ (Phil. 1:27).

This is an “encouragement in Christ”—that is, it is carried out in Christ. We stand by one another in Christ.
