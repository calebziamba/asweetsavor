This is the third message shared during the January 2009 [Jesus Lovers’ Training](https://www.asweetsavor.org/conference-loving-the-lord-jesus/)

While the various world religions teach people to worship, fear, and obey God, none of them teach people to love God. Only in the Bible do we see that God desires so much that we would love Him. The Bible tells us God is love, and that we need to abide in this love. Actually, we need to grow, by means of God’s provisions for us, so that we may enter into a fuller realization of His love. The more we grow and mature as Christians, the more we will be able to appreciate and enjoy His love for us.
