_“Our rafters, cypresses”  
– Song of Songs 1:17  
_

What does cypress represent in the Bible? Cypress trees were planted beside graves, and therefore cypress wood indicates that, along with the Lord’s humanity, there is also death being expressed in us, the death produced through the work of the cross. If you are willing to let the cross work in you, you will express the Lord’s death. Although the cross puts you to death, you become a person who really functions, for your death helps manifest your function in the building.

Adapted from _[The Song of Songs: A Divine Romance](/song-of-songs-dr "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu, page 69.
