_For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation. â€” Galatians 6:15_

We often think that our positive virtues are good for the church. Perhaps one brother is very nice, another is very humble, and another is very zealous. Can our niceness, humility, and zeal be for the church? No. The church can only be built up with what is created in us as a part of the new creation.
