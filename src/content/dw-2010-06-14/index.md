We are a blessed people if we know who the apostles are. They are those who are able to raise up the churches and supply them with the riches of Christ. In this past century the Lord gave Brother Lee to us in such a capacity. He raised us up and helped us through all the storms in the church life. He was not merely a teacher, but a father, to us who knew him. Where would we be spiritually without his leadership, guidance, and direction? We may say that such spiritual oversight is not necessary for our spiritual well being, but this is not true.

Even if we think we do not have an apostle to guide us today, we all should have elders. We should not be wild, declaring that today we are one with this and tomorrow we are one with that. We should not have an attitude of questioning, “Who are the elders anyway? Why must I listen to them?” If we do this, we prove that we are ignorant and do not realize what God has ordained for us. Without the elders we lose our protection. We must pay attention to the teaching of the apostles and never rebel against the apostles’ authority. This is why the church in the first century experienced the genuine one accord.
