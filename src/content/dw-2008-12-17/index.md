_Then He brought me back to the entrance of the house, and there was water flowing out from under the threshold of the house to the east.... —Ezekiel 47:1_

_In Him you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. —Ephesians 2:22_

Some may think that a larger church would experience a greater flow. That is not necessarily the case, however. What determines the flow of life is the degree to which you are built up in your locality. Even if there are only 20 saints in your locality, your church can experience becoming a source of the divine flow. The requirement to experience this divine flow is your being built up.

If the Lord has a church of which He can say, “My throne is established in this place—I am at rest here,” then assuredly the flow will come forth in that church regardless of how many saints are meeting there. Should 30 saints be loving the Lord together, pursuing Him together, serving together, and preaching the gospel together, then these 30 saints will experience the flowing forth of the divine river.
