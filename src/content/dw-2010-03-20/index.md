_"Many times they have afflicted me from my youth," Let Israel now say; "Many times have they afflicted me since my youth, yet they did not prevail against me." — Psalm 129:1-2_

All of the saints who have been in the church life for many years may not feel prevailing or useful, but the fact is that they are still here. It is not a small thing that they have remained after going through so many difficulties and trials. Praise the Lord, they are still here! They are a blessing to the church! Once they were only spiritual by themselves, but now they have progressed to having a maturity for the entire Body of Christ.

For the Lord to gain His testimony there is the need for us to be enlarged. The first and best instrument the Lord uses to enlarge us is affliction. We have to be thankful to the Lord. He allows us to experience trials and afflictions so that we would mature into a blessing to the Body.
