_"O my dove, In the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." — Song of Songs 2:14_

In verse 14 the Lord refers to the Shulammite as His "dove." The Lord once said her eyes were like the eyes of a dove. Now she herself becomes a dove. In the eyes of the Lord, she is truly beautiful now. Not only her eyes but also her whole person is pure. We don’t see as the Lord does; we do not think we are like doves. However, the Lord says, “You are like a dove. I am going to work in you and make you a dove.”
