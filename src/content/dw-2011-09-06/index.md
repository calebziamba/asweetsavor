_For as a man thinks in his heart, so he is. — Proverbs 23:7a_ We live before God according to our purity, and we live among men according to our view. Our purity decides how well we grow before God and how well we are able to understand spiritual things. Our view decides our manner of life among men and how we operate in this life (Prov. 23:7a).

When we are one with God, our view will be one with God’s view. If we are thinking the same way that God is thinking, then we are people touching God’s heart.
