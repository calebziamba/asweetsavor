We also need to enjoy Christ as the word of life. The Lord Jesus said, in John 5:39–40,

_You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me; and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life._

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 90.
