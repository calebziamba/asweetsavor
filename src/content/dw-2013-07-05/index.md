_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons._ _— Philippians 1:1_

A bond-servant of the Lord will experience the suffering Jesus (Matt. 10:24–25). People ask, “What are you doing with your life?” The bond-servant replies, “I’m a slave of the Lord.”

Such slaves walk the same path as the suffering Jesus, but they have a wonderful Master. They can say, “The King of Kings and the Lord of Lords is my Master. He is the One on the throne. However, I also have the experience of the suffering Jesus. I am despised and considered as nothing.” This is to be a slave of Christ Jesus.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians "Go to the listing for this book.")_ pages 14-15.
