_When Jehovah turned again the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream. At that time our mouth was filled with laughter And our tongue with a ringing shout. — Psalm 126:1-2a_

The psalmist speaks here of a joy that is impossible to describe. This is our experience when we first came into the church life. “When Jehovah turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like those that dream.” The turning of our captivity indicates that we were those searching and struggling, possibly for many years. Then one day our captivity was turned, and what we longed for became our reality. When this happened, all we could say was, “This is a dream come true!”
