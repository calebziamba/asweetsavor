_If you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God._ _â€“ Colossians 3:1_

When we were born again, we became one with the resurrected Christ. This means that when the Lord Jesus was raised from the dead, we were also raised with Him. Just as the Lord has passed out of death into life, so we also are in resurrection.
