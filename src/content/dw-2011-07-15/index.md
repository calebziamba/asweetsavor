_Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership. — First Timothy 4:14_

My experience of the Spirit somewhat matches that of Timothy (1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6). I received the Lord when I was in high school. I began to read the Bible, preach the gospel, and serve in the church life. I became known as a crazy Jesus-lover. Everyone at school knew that I was on fire for Jesus Christ. It may seem like that would have been enough to satisfy my desire to serve the Lord, but eventually I felt strongly constrained to give my life to Him completely. I shared this desire with the elders. That Saturday night there was a meeting, and they asked me to testify how I wanted to live for Christ and Christ alone.

After reading a letter of consecration I had written and giving my testimony, I knelt down, and four elders of the church laid their hands on me. At that time I experienced what Psalm 133 mentions about the Lord’s anointing descending from on high. I began to weep so strongly that I could not stand. Others had to lift me up and walk me to my seat. I could not stop weeping until the following day. I was so touched by the Lord’s love. I believe it was as the verses that say, “The love of Christ compels us…” (2 Cor. 5:14–15). I felt that the Lord was so good, so lovely, and so precious. I became a different person. I became so bold before God and man. After I experienced the Lord’s anointing in this way, I felt like the happiest person on the globe, for at that moment God and I were totally one.
