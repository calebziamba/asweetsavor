_David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down to him. And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. — 1 Samuel 22:1-2_

In order to take the group of hapless people God sent to him and form them into an army , David paid attention to four matters.

First, he remained in the Lord’s presence, learning to trust Him in all things, even in times of defeat. Second, he cared for those the Lord sent to him, investing himself in them. Third, he trained them to do as he did: to trust in God and invest themselves in others. Finally, he provided opportunities for them to use what they learned—a field to labor in.
