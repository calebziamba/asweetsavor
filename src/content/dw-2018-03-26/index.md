_Holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain._ _—Philippians 2:16_

If we take such a firm stand, have a receiving spirit, and apply what we have seen, we can confidently present the word of life to those in the crooked and perverse generation around us. What we see needs to become an outflow. May the Lord bring us all into this process so that others may behold Christ shining out through us.

Adapted from _[Philippians: That I May Gain Christ](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book."),_ by Titus Chu; page 132.
