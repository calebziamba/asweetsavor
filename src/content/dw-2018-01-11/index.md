If we feel the Lord is more valuable than before, we are on the right track. Though we may not feel much excitement, the Lord within us seems more valuable, exalted, abundant, powerful, and attractive. The Lord never changes, yet to us He seems different because we have more revelation and knowledge of Him. When this is our experience, we know we are on the right way.
