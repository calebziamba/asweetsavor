_“My mother’s sons were angry with me;_ _They made me caretaker of the vineyards,_ _But I have not taken care of my own vineyard.”_ _– Song of Songs 1:6_

When you have an intimate relationship with the Lord and He shines upon you, you will find that you become burdened for the vineyard. At that point, the Lord looks upon you. His shining not only makes you realize that you are black, but also causes others to see you as black. They feel that you are not willing to cooperate with them, and you feel that you yourself could not function in any place, for they are angry with you. When you did not have a special relationship with the Lord and were without His shining, you had no problems with these brothers, for you just went along with whatever happened in the church life. Once you have a special relationship with the Lord, however, you will find no rest, for in carrying out your burden you will encounter these brothers.
