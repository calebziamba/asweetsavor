_But Moses' hands were heavy. Then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other. Thus his hands were steady until the sun set. — Exodus 17:12_ As Moses’ hands grew heavy, Aaron and Hur placed a stone under him for him to sit upon and supported his arms until the going down of the sun (Exo. 17:12). Joshua’s job was to chop off the Amalekites’ heads, but it was Moses’ prayer that caused the Amalekite's necks to become exposed to Joshua’s sword.

Our experience is like this. When I was young, as long as I preached, people got saved. Hundreds were saved in a few months time, and over sixty were baptized. When Moses prayed with his hands lifted up, it was as though the Amalekites lined up for slaughter by Joshua and his men. When Moses’ hands were no longer lifted up, however, the Israelites lost ground and were pursued by Amalek. When Moses’ hands were again lifted up, the Amalekites fell under the Israelites’ sword once more. This is our initial experience of spiritual battle. When it is over, we do not even know how it was possible that we prevailed. How did such a revival take place? Why were people so readily brought to the Lord? It was because Christ and His interceding believers had been lifting up their hands in prayer.

The church must stand with those fighting the battle in the gospel so that those they speak with may be ready to receive. Those who go forth should realize it was not they themselves who win the battle but rather those who stand with their arms outstretched. It is the praying believers and the interceding Christ who bring in the victory.
