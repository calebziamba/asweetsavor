_Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. — Philippians 2:5–7_

Christ’s “being made in the likeness of men” implies that He went through a process. He only cared for what God desired. In Him there was nothing that resisted God’s will.

He voluntarily gave up the form of God so that He might enter into this process and accomplish the universal salvation that we partake of today. Regardless of the magnitude of the sacrifice, He went through every step of this process to fully accomplish what was in the heart of God.
