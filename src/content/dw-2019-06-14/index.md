_“The king has brought me into his chambers._  
_We will rejoice in you and be glad;_  
_We will extol your love more than wine._  
_Rightly do they love you.”_  
_– Song of Songs 1:4_

If the love of the Lord touches us, we will tell Him, “Lord, You are my King.” In contrast, if we are in the realm of duty, it means we have left the Lord as our first love.
