In one vision there are a lot of revelations… Often, we do have a vision, but because of ignorance our vision becomes a simple picture, lacking depth or profoundness… We follow the Lord and the Lord will give a vision. Then, in our faithfulness to it, we grow. In this growth there are innumerable revelations. Then, as we grow, we’ll get another vision. As we’re faithful and grow more, then we’ll get a third vision. Each vision produces a lot of revelations.
