_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._ _– Philippians 1:1_

To labor with commitment is very meaningful and enjoyable. It is like a young man and woman getting married. Normally, marriage is preceded by a time of courtship. Suppose a couple skips this time and simply announces one day that they are getting married. This is not nearly as romantic, meaningful, and enjoyable as the young man wooing the young woman’s heart until she loves him.

Adapted from _[Philippians: "That I May Gain Christ,"](/book-philippians/ "Go to the listing for this book")  
_by Titus Chu, pages 162-163.
