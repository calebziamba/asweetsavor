_I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ._ _– Philippians 3:8_

Philippians is a book of joyfulness. Joy is the normal result of a life that is pure and focused. If we tell the Lord, “I only want You, and I live only for You,” then we will rejoice. Our lives will become very happy. Joy is the source, the initial stage, and rejoicing is the development of joy. When our joy becomes so rich and bountiful that it overflows, that is to rejoice. The Christian life according to Philippians should be so joyful.
