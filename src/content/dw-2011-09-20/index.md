The Old Testament example of the ark being separated from the tabernacle (cf. 1 Sam. 4) corresponds to how we often feel about the church life. For example, every Lord’s Day morning we have the Lord’s Table, in which we remember the Lord and worship the Father. Then every Tuesday night we come together to pray. We may have a serving life, and we may have the preaching of the gospel. Our setting seems right, because we are the tabernacle of God. We have the outer court, the Holy Place, and even the Holy of Holies. Yet we are short of the ark of testimony. We are short of the substance and reality of the church life.
