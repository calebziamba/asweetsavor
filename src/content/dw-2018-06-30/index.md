_“This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.”_ _– John 15:12_

“Thank You, Lord, that we are born again. Now we want to enjoy and carry out Your commissions. We want to live the body life by enjoying You as life and grace. We are not here for ourselves; we are here for Your interest. Strengthen us to carry out these commissions! We give ourselves to You, that we would love one another, keep the oneness, and feed Your lambs. Thank You, Lord Jesus, for these three commissions!”

Adapted from _[Born Again: Our New Life in Christ](/book-born-again/ "Go to the listing for this book"),_ by Titus Chu; page 102.
