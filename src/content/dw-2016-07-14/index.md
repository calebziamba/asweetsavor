A number of leaders such as Alexander the Great have changed the history of the world. They were the elite of the world. Not many can accomplish what these accomplished. However, no matter how good their personality, character, or nature was, they could not serve the Lord in the church. The Lord cannot use anything natural. If you desire to follow the Lord, you must have a personality that is produced from the divine nature.
