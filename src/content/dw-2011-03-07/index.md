_"The king has brought me into his chambers." — Song of Songs 1:4b_

_“Our couch is green.” — Song of Songs 1:16b_

_"Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shade I sat down with great delight, And his fruit was sweet unto my taste." — Song of Songs 2:3_ In Song of Songs 2:3 the seeker delights and sits in the shade of her lover, whom she likens to this most lovely fruit tree.

Originally she was in the king’s chambers, and then she progressed to experience resting on the green couch. At this point in her experience, however, her beloved has become the most prominent tree among the trees of the wood. His life has become her covering. When we come to experience the Lord in this way, we sit down in His shade, and His life covers us, becoming our strength and even our delight.

According to Watchman Nee, this refers to the rapture. Because of the riches of life, we are not only delighted, but we also feel we are experiencing heaven on earth. To our feeling, nothing could be higher than this.
