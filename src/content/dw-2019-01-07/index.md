If we are young in the Lord, “revelation,” “vision,” and “bearing the cross” may just be terms without reality. This is because we don’t yet have many experiences in the church life. We haven’t had much opportunity to suffer for the Lord and to know how weak we are. However, if we keep loving the Lord and the church, the Lord will work in us.
