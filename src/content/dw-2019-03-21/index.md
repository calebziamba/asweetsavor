_Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus._ _– Philippians 1:1_

_But you know of \[Timothy’s\] proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.  
__– Philippians 2:22_  
  
The father-child relationship can lead to an over-appreciation of a spiritual father, which can lead to the development of factions, divisions, or sects among the believers (1 Cor. 1:12–13). However, taking the same stand together as bond-servants of Jesus Christ can save us from this.
