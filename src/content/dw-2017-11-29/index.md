_Do all things without grumbling or disputing; so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world._ _—Philippians 2:14–15_

God has given every believer talents that are of use to Him. These talents are meant for us to use unto His glory. However, Satan utilizes each generation of the world to cause the believers to become bent and crooked. Under the influence of each generation, people end up far from where God intended, wasting their God-given talents on things that yield nothing to God. Satan makes them feel that this is in their interest, but actually it is in Satan’s interest.
