> _“Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are differences of operation, but it is the same God who operates all things in all.”_
> 
> _(1 Corinthians 12:4-6)_

We all are gifted differently, therefore, when we each have a ministry, then all ministries will be different. There is no comparing them and no competition between them, but one helps the other. One supports the other. One strengthens the other. One stands with the other. One perfects the other.
