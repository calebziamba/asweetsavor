> letâ€™s keep living by that same _standard_ to which we have attained.

> \-- Philippians 3:16 NASB

Instead of pursuing Christ, too many Christians today pursue things of the religious world in their self-life. Because of this, they harm those they are trying to help. This is why Paul said we should walk according to the standard to which we have attained. When we are all uniquely focused on simply gaining Christ, there are no problems. Problems arise when we attempt to gain something other than Christ or act beyond our measure  
of Christ.
