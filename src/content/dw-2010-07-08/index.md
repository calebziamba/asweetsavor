_All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. —2 Timothy 3:16_

After you acquire various kinds of Bibles, you must read them! You should read the Bible over and over again until you become familiar with what is contained in it.

If you are young and have a strong desire to pursue, I advise you to read quickly through the first eight chapters of Romans and all of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews, 1 John, and Revelation. These are the most crucial books in the Bible. You should read them over and over again. You should also be familiar with Genesis in the Old Testament, for it contains all the “seeds” and principles that are developed throughout the rest of the Bible.

There are different ways to read the Bible. We should read through the whole Bible quickly. We also need to go through every verse, every chapter, and every book carefully. We have to learn how to pray over the Bible, study it, and scan it. Brother Lee taught us not to memorize an entire book, but rather to focus on the important verses. Those who desire to serve full-time cannot be satisfied with reading the Bible merely five or six times. If you desire to be a teacher, you should read every book, every chapter, and every verse again and again.

In the beginning, we should study the facts of the Bible and become familiar with the content of every book and every chapter. We must understand how the portions are connected together. We all should know the Bible to the extent that it becomes the leading and controlling factor of our life.
